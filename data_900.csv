Complaints,0"Horrible experience! Very frustrating!. Booked a trip through Expedia. The day before we were supposed to leave, they told me the hotel wasn't opened yet. Too late to book anything else, had to cancel the whole trip. They gave me credits. Now booked another trip, and they can't find the credits! Can't talk to anyone. No one speaks english. They blatantly lied to me about using the credit, had me use my credit card, and said they would refund the first tickets. Now, no credit!!! THEY SUCK!!!!!",booking"Expedia offers NO HELP if there's a problem. This was a vacation package from Tulsa to Jamaica.  I was delayed at DFW; on hold for over an hour; no help with alternative flights; lost one day at expensive resort and had to pay to stay at an airport hotel.  Airline lost luggage; Expedia wouldn't help; lost another 2 days at resort. Paid to get luggage. Return trip, stranded at DFW again; had to pay two strangers to drive me home because Expedia wouldn't help me find a flight home. Spent almost $9,000 for a 9-day vacation and got only six.",booking"Expedia Bundle Deal Review from London, England. We are due to fly to Orlando on Sunday for a weeks holiday with my sister and her family as we have recently lost our Mum. We booked the whole trip with Expedia. Last week we tried to confirm the villa both with Expedia and the villa company and discovered that Expedua hadn't confirmed with the villa company and they aren't answering they're phones so we now don't have a reservation despite us paying for it upfront. Expedia seem unable to find us anywhere to stay and my husband has now spent about 10 hours on the phone to the USA mostly on hold, still with no resolution. We are now unsure wether to travel and have not been given any idea what to do. Shambles.",booking"Expedia Cheats Its Customers!. Here's the first half of my post: In November I bought 4 tickets to St. Croix as a Christmas gift for my daughter, son-in-law and 2 young grandchildren.

I bought a flight from Quito to the Galapagos for $168, which I thought was a great deal.  When I was about to leave the Galapagos, LAN charged me ANOTHER $168 to leave because Expedia sold me a ticket that was only for Ecuadorian citizens.  LAN's tickets clearly say on their website that the tickets at that price are only for Ecuadorian citizens, but NO WHERE on Expedia's site when buying the tickets does it say that only Ecuadorian's can buy them.  Therefore I was stranded and had to PAY DOUBLE to leave.  I could not afford to go at the more expensive price and would have not have gone if I had known.  Expedia will not help me out at all and claims it is an ""additional fee"" from the airline, however Expedia sold and American citizen, unknown to me, a ticket only Ecuadorian's can buy and I had to pay out of pocket.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  DO NOT BUY FROM EXPEDIA!",bookingExpedia Reservations Review. I provided correct name jn my reservation but they booked with incorrect name with the airline,booking"INCOMPETENT customer service. I called to change the hotel portion of my bundle deal, the girl i talked to gave me a rate and i agreed to go ahead with the change, she didn't cancel the 1st hotel and booked the second  hotel with the wrong amount of people (it was an all inclusive hotel). She admitted to messing up the reservation and that someone would call me back. She assured me that I wouldnt be charged more then i had. No one called me back so i called back 2 days later and they would not give me the same deal. Because of one customer service person I do not have a reservation now and I am not able to cancel the flights and cannot get a bundle deal. So Im out hundreds of dollars. I am a long time Expedia customer that will never use them again.",booking"Deceptive pricing on air fares. Beware of using Expedia to book international flights. I recently travel to New Zealand from Sydney on Virgin Australia airline, operated by Air New Zealand, via online tickets purchased through Expedia.com. When we went to check-in and check backage, the Air New Zealand agent could not check us in. After investigating the problem, she found that our tickets did not include any checked baggage, and we would have to pay $NZ 120 per bag (approximately $90 per bag). She recommended we check with the Virgin Australia desk and see if they could do anything. Virgin Australia asked us if we had booked via Expedia and we said yes. The agent told us that Expedia was notorious for selling tickets online as ""seat only"" without checked baggage inclusion. We wound up having to pay $NZ 480 for four checked bags.  When booking the flight online two U.S. past in front of my computer, and checked the dates and times and details closely, as we did notwant to make any errors in this connection from Sydney. Nowhere on the screen were we warned that baggage would cost us $NZ 90 extra per piece.  The fine print on the confirmation did have a comment that the airline may charge additional fees per baggage, but that was not unusual, most U.S, carrier charge $25 per bag, too, but no one charges $90 per bag.  This is an obvious ploy by Expedia to make their pricing seem more attractive, and per the airlines, many travelers get stung by this unexpected charge. I also fault Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia, as there had been a flight cancellation and re-routing involved. Our direct flight from Queenstown, NZ to Sydney Australia was cancelled out from under us, and they sent an email showing we now had a flight to Sydney from Wellington, NZ!  Since Queenstown (where our outbound return flight was supposed to originate) is over 500 miles away from Picton, then a 3-hour ferry ride From Picton to Wellington, I quickly called the airlines. They told me I had to contact Expedia to correct this oversight. Expedia made the correction, but charged us an additional fee for the added leg! The agent noted that our additional flight did not include baggage, and asked if we would be checking baggage. We said yes. He did not mention that our inbound portion from Sydney to Wellington did not show checked baggage either. I travel a lot (53 trips outside the USA since 1971, and uncounted vacation and business tripswithin the USA). I have never experience such a royal screw-up by an airline or travel service. I will never use Expedia to book a hotel, airline ticket or car again!",booking"Expedia claimed that there is limitation on their system and they cannot locate my booking details.

But when we tried to check in for our Aug 24, 2015 flight from Honolulu to Shanghai with connecting flight Shanghai to Jinan there was no such flight at all that day !  We spent HOURS and HOURS on the phone with Expedia, mostly on hold with a polite but incapable customer service representative with strong Indian accent who would come on, apologize for the delay, explain that he was not able to do anything about our situation and needed to talk to his supervisor whom he could not reach.  Eventually we were told the Honolulu to Shanghai flight was now rebooked for the following day. When we asked if the connecting flight was adjusted accordingly, we were put on hold again for hours without ever getting a clear answer. We made it to Shanghai where it turned out that Expedia had done nothing to adjust the connecting flight and we wound up spending 4 hours at the airport there trying to sort it out on our own.  We understand that flight schedule changes can happen but why were we not informed ??? Why was the connecting flight not adjusted ? When I submitted my complaint with Expedia I got a wishy-washy general template answer.  The hotels we booked through Expedia for this trip were all fabulous which is in line with our past experience with Expedia.

We have booked flights n hotel thro Expedia from Glasgow - Gatwick - Cancun and then return. (Also booked hotel)  Unfortunately we have been given return flights by Expedia from Cancun - Gatwick and then Heathrow - Glasgow. Now this is totally illogical.  Obviously our intent was to return to Glasgow via Gatwick.   Expedia tell me that I chose the Heathrow option.  I certainly did not consciously do so - and surely Expedia should have flagged my choice up at the time of booking as would have happened with a face to face travel agent?  We will be travelling from Cancun to Gatwick and so have had to purchase at huge price (over �500) to travel then on to Glasgow from Gatwick. This is a nonsense and unacceptable. I expect Expedia to deal with this and compensate us for the extra �500 outlay. I can assure you that I will never book thro Expedia again - there are not the prompts as they claim there are and any possible mistake in ticking the wrong box is not highlighted...................   This had cost us very dearly - a full 25% of our entire holiday. Perhaps Expedia might contact me to explain and compensate??,bookingExpedia reservation Review.

Just had a similar experience with Expedia . booked a hotel and last minute deal could not be honoured came up. i have been moved to another hotel nearly 2 kilometres away from where I wanted to be and of very inferior quality. Have just visited the original hotel and asked about the booking and they tell me experia were aware of this at the time they accepted my money for the original booking. experia are nothing short of robbers. They will not answer any emails or correspondence.  spoilt the holiday from day one. if they had informed me 6 weeks ago that they could not honour the booking i could have made different arrangements. anyone know of a good solicitor in these matters.,bookingDeceptive practices. I searched a hotel name and a 1888 number came up.  I thought I was speaking to reservations at the hotel.  I asked for a government rate since I was traveling on business.  I was told there were none.  I also said I was tax exempt and was told just to present the certificate at the hotel.  At no time was Expedia ever identified as the agent I was dealing with.  Even the confirmation document had no mention of Expedia.  I never book thru Expedia for business travel because it does not give government rate or tax exempt status.  I called customer service and was sent to 6. Yes 6 different numbers and had to give all my information each time. I finally got fed up and hung up but I am disputing the tax charge on my credit card. Expedia is very deceptive in their reservation practices.,booking" Expidia. Done with Expedia.  Booked a hotel room thru Expedia for Sept 6th, 2015.  Got email from  Expedia that it was not necessary to confirm.  Upon arrival to hotel there was a sign on the door that said they were closed for remodeling. No cars, no staff, nothing.  I called Expedia customer service and got the runaround.  After one week, over two hours on telephone with customer service I still have not been able to get a refund.  Expedia customer service keep telling me that they need to talk to the hotel manager in order to refund my reservation.  They cannot understand that the hotel is CLOSED.  NOBODY IS THERE.  By the way, Expedia did inform me that if they do process a refund that there will be a cancellation fee almost equal to the amount of my charges.",booking"Flight change, no update!. I'm stranded in San Jose from a flight change I was not notified for.  I purchased my flights 8 months in advance and I am a high volume Expedia user and expect amazing customer service.  Upon calling in for help, I spoke to a foreign operator who couldn't understand English asking me to verify and reverify all your name/numbers/itinerary/travel date/phone/email, etc... when stuck at the airport trying to resolve, this is infuriatingly redundant and insulting when they already have 100% of the information pulled up in front of them.  The communication barrier was painful, as was trying to decode her accent in my state of fury.  There was zero resolution from the operator, only stating that as per Expedia company policy that they email until the customer has verified or will call to verify.  Neither of those happened although the agent quoted the date the email was sent in April, I did not get it (I never delete email and have other updated itineraries in my email for other trips).  I asked where they failed as I did not respond to an email I did not get, and they said the issue was 'closed' and she did not know how it failed.  I was then told to take whatever the airline offered as a replacement.  Airline says drive to SF to catch a flight that leaves in 90 mins OR buy a ticket on Southwest for $300 OR buy a ticket for the next day.   NOT STOKED. Lesson learned, buy direct from the airlines if you don't need to bundle car/hotel.",booking"Expidea even cannot issue a proper ticket. Fundamental fail as a travel agency.. Our flight from Sydney to San Jose has been changed by the airline, due to a schedule change, and has now left us with an invalid return journey, as we are now expected to make a flight change in 12min at LAX. After 7 calls to the customer service team, where we have been made to wait for close to 1h several times, and repeatedly hung up on, our new ticket has still not been reissued. This is a business trip on a tight schedule. This situation is causing problems for us as  we cannot confirm any meeting schedules with our clients. We have already called the airlines we are flying with directly. They are very helpful and willing to change our ticket, however, they cannot do this without Expedia's cooperation as the ticket is under Expedia control.

I got a great price for a Hertz rental car on Expedia.  I had also previously downloaded the Expedia app on my android phone so I could manage my flight and reservation.   Well when I got to the Hertz counter at MCO, the line was at least ten people deep, there was one poor dude working the counter who was obviously helping a customer where a car rental had gone wrong, and the line was not moving.  At all. I attemtped to cancel the reservation on my Expedia app, which by the way was not working properly.  And I had an important appointment I had to get to and it was clear I was not going to make the appointment with the extremely long line at Hertz.  BTW, there were no lines at all at any of the other car rental counters. I did take a chance by not waiting it out at the Hertz counter.  Expedia was no help at all.  When I called Hertz, they said I had to go thru Expedia.  Try to find a phone number for Expedia when your app isn't working.  What a joke.   So to make a long story short, I had to pay for the Hertz rental which I never used due to a ""nonrefundable reservation.""  So to sum it up, I will NEVER do business with either Hertz or Expedia again.  EVER.",bookingExpedia booking Review.

I made a reservation through Expedia for a king size bed/non-smoking room at Antilley Inn. Upon arriving at this location, nothing on the outside screamed turn your car around and get out while you can. This location has pretty nice curb appeal, except the parking lot is badly cracked and falling apart and is close to a really good hospital. So, I parked, picked up my room key from the office and drove to find my room. Even through I was running late for a prior engagement I made time to check this room out since I've been having some really bad luck with some other Abilene hotels and motels. The only thing I noticed was that the room had two beds in it except the king sized bed I had reserved. I thought to go ahead to my meeting and speak to the clerk when I get back, I' m sure this was an honest mistake. Somewhere between 9 and 9:30 P.M. I return to the motel and advise the clerk that that was not the room I reserved and continued to explain that I was not interested in double beds. The clerk tells me that the air conditioning on the second floor where all the king size beds are was out of order and that' s why I was put in this room. He told me that it would takes very long time to get it cool. At no time when I checked in or now at 9 did the clerk now I learn he is the owner/operator at this location never offered me a refund so that I might find a king size bed somewhere else in Abilene. It gets worst. So now I' m stuck with this room that I don't want since it's one of those Expedia deals (no cancellation or refunds) and find a swatch of blood on the bathroom door. Did I mention the air conditioner in our room isn't working right either. I call the clerk, about the blood and the owner comes to the room and cleans the blood off with his thumb. He swears it' s not blood but jam and that he and his wife clean the rooms. Personally, I think blood would not be left on the bathroom door of a clean room, jam either. The coffee pot and other appliances are dusty. The toilet doesn't flush right. Yeah. Before I forget. The air conditioner is set to 60 and several hours pass and the room still feels stuffy and like it' s in the upper 70's.  It's almost midnight and I finally get through to Expedia. And after several minutes on the phone with him I' m told that there is absolutely nothing that he can do for me. He' s also called the owner and tells me that he wants to put me in the hot room or I could get my money back without a penalty to get another room elsewhere. I told the man on the phone I'll stay, after all it is after midnight and my spouse is diabetic.  I don't know about any of the other rooms but the room I had had termites outside the room door I killed one that had gotten inside but probably the worst part of all was that the room has a terrible problem with bed bugs. I woke up with several bites and two huge red blotches on my body and took picture to prove it. I believe this bad situation could have been handled better, I would have liked to have been told at check in that the king size room was not available and right then been offered a refund to relocate.  The room mix up was no mistake.  The only mistake was that I booked a room there through Expedia. Never again Expedia. Never again. Buyer beware and stay here if you dare.",booking"Review from New York, New York. We originally booked Viceroy resort through expedia.com in Jan/Feb time. We planned to travel to the Maldives for our honeymoon in September 24, 2015. We loved that the property had spaced out villas that were not cramped together like the other resorts. We saw many rave reviews about the service and experience, we decided this would be the perfect honeymoon location. Sunday, August 23, rolls around and we get a call from Expedia, a representative calls us at 7am. She informs us that the resort has no space for us due to renovations and will have to relocate us. For our troubles she confirms that all the other properties that she looks for has exactly the same perks that they Viceroy will have. Expedia says that the seaplane transport will be ""covered"". Ok then, fine. We hang up and we never get a confirmation of the change the day after. I call Expedia a day after, to confirm that we did indeed were relocated. No. We are not. We get a confirmation that we are staying at Viceroy resort from Expedia. The *** is going on? Fine we are happy to stay with Viceroy. Being that I am unsettled by how this is handled my wife and I contact Viceroy management through their email. We wanted to know whether we still had a reservation there. Management (by a name of Sandra Limon) confirms that we have been relocated to the new location. However, seaplane transport was not agreed upon and not compensated by resort. Ok, so now we are going around in circles. Once again, we call expedia to clear the details. If resort has confirmed relocation but not covering for seaplane then why did expedia say that? I have talked to the following representatives on Expedia: Karen, Anastasia, Roy, Allie, Tara, +Supervisors (**Not sure if these are stage names**). On all occasions except on the last call I was told it was covered. I even went as far as telling them to please send me confirmation through email, explicit that the seaplane transport would be taken care of. Of course they would tell me we don't send the email but we have it in our system. Another pain point is that both resorts were not reachable by phone when Expedia called. Last night 1AM US EST I call Expedia. I had to stay up late night to get on a call for 1.5+ hrs for expedia to speak with either Viceroy or other resort for them to finally confirm relocation. I make the point that the relocation should have happened long before this. At this time of booking there are limited options available for us. This is not a business trip. We spend money and want our honeymoon to be perfect. I speak to supervisors from Expedia and at first they tell me if they had communicated that the transport was covered that they would honor it to the best of their abilities. After the supervisor speaks to her ""supervisor"", she informs me sorry, we can't do anything for you, lets transfer you to the relocation department. Blip. The relocation department picks up and has NO idea of any of these details... just wonderful.. the representive at least offers to book another resort. So my review is for the communications between the Viceroy and Expedia.",booking"Review from College Park, Maryland. I just booked a vacation package ""bundle"" that included air fare.

I immediately called Frontier who told me they don't fly to Daytona Beach and to call Expedia. I called Expedia and after 1  1/2 hours on the phone, I hung up.

After a big headache at the airport, son crying etc..., Expedia attendant told me to buy new tickets by myself to travel next day, and so I did (paying 3 times the regular price). Expedia attendant told me they would reimburse the difference. After 10 month, dozens of calls, dozens of emails, all the documents/receipts etc sent, getting sick because of it, they finally told me they will not pay my money back, so the difference from original tickets to the new tickets I was obligated to buy will be my loss.",booking"EXPEDIA/reservationcounter.com SCAM. I thought i was booking through embassy suites hotel.  I never received confirmation.  I called the hotel and they said my reservation was through Expedia.  Expedia said the reservation wasn't through them but they conveniently had my itinerary number as well as a phone number for their affiliate reservationcounter.com.  after 20 minutes on the phone with someone in guatemala, I was unable to change my reservation.  I also learned that they had charged my credit card some time ago and this was now considered a ""prepaid"" reservation.  I am more than angry right now. The rate is also much higher than the hotel rate $200/night versus hotel rate of $124/night.  NEVER USE EXPEDIA...THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU.",booking"Expedia booking Review from Ottawa, Ontario. Well I purchased a recommended hotel in Chios and used PayPal. Bad choice both ways. PayPal under their terms clearly state travel is not protected so don't use them! Use Visa etc. The hotel had no air conditioning working and was bug infested. It's been 7 weeks and Expedia has done nothing but ignore me.

My family and I had planned a nice relaxing easy trip to Disneyland. With Expedia this was not the case. We were promised a two rooms at the Sheraton park hotel in Anaheim California and each room we were told had two beds in each room when we go there they said they had a reservation for two rooms with a single bed  when we told the hotel manager about our reservation he told us it was not the first time Expedia pulled this kind of ***. Many other guests experienced the sam issue we did. When we contacted Expedia about this issue the person who talked to us about it was not only rude and refused to get the supervisor to  actually assist us, they made us wait for an hour to finally get connected to the manager, which after another hour we got the same answer that they aren't responsible for this error and in the end got stuck with the one bed room rooms.This wasn't even where the nightmare started nor ended our flights were a living ***. Since the Expedia policy only allows up to 6 people per group trip we had to book a flight for my son separately and the wanted to put 6 of us on one flight and him on another that was an hour after our flight. After another hour on the phone we got the flights switched. We thought everything was fixed and we were good to go for Disneyland the next day. We were wrong about that when we got to the gate the person at the ticket booth said the ticket reservation was missing and that Expedia did not send the information over for them. She also told us Expedia has done that to past families as well, luckily she was nice enough to give us a complimentary park hopper pass for the day until we got ours sorted out. When we got our passes they only had 6 names for six passes and my sons name was missing on them and when we got to disney it took them awhile to allow our son to enter with us(This was not the fault of Disney it was Expedia's neglect to add our sons name to the passes). When we went to go get our rental car for the week not only was it located 10 minutes away from LAX it was a business not licensed to operate on the airport property which meant we had to take a connect bus to a holding lot near the airport where you then had to call the rental company to come picks us up. The building it was located in was very shady and the van we got wasn't clean. When we came back home we reviewed our purchases to make sure our charges were right that is when we noticed that the flight for my son that they booked originally never got refunded back to us and they said we had to contact the airline and that it could take up to 8 weeks to get refunded. Since we had to go to Seattle for a wedding and we stayed over night we chose to book our hotel with Expedia as well as my sister in law when she called to confirm our reservations hers was missing but luckily ours was found. When we called them about this it took them about 30 minutes to connect us to someone to help us and then when we asked for a supervisor it took them an hour to get connected again. To summarize our trip and our experience with Expedia we most definitely will not use them ever again the only time we would do that is well, we would never and I do not suggest to use it go to other websites such as hotwire or travelocity, and seeing as others have been lied to by Expedia I do not recommend to use them ever. As I type this review I am still trying to speak with their customer service and told us that they do not care if they loose our business which shows how little they value the comfort of their customers. Overall terrible experience and the people who are supposed to help you are very rude as well.",booking"Expedia booking Review.

The airline ticket does NOT include the price of seats. Airline will charge a fee to assign seats as booked via Expedia. Or you have to buy a seat on each leg of trip on website. The excuse that ""it says it in the contract"" is a lame one as there is NO statement that there is a cost on top of what you pay. Expedia said they don't include that b/c it ""MAY"" happen but not always. Baloney. And customer service reads the answer over and over. You as customer are out of luck. and expedia has lost another customer",booking"Expedia takes money but doesn't follow through. I NEVER write reviews but must warn others. Just took my kids to Disneyland. Booked the trip on Expedia (first time) including three - 4 day Disneyland Park Hopper passes ($900). Got to park the first day (July 25) and they had no record of the tickets being reserved (even though I had the vouchers printed off from Expedia & my ID). Spent about 30 minutes at the ticket booth. Disneyland was nice enough to give us complimentary passes for one day but said I needed to call Expedia and have them put my reservation into their system. While my kids went on rides without me I spent over TWO HOURS on the phone with Expedia (which by the way it's SUPER loud in Disneyland so very hard to hear & talk to a person with a thick accent). When all was said and done, Expedia said they would send a fax to Disney showing that I had the reservations and an email to me confirming and would send me a $50 voucher for my inconvenience. After a couple hours I dragged my family back to the Disney ticket booth where they still had not received anything from Expedia but after another half hour of standing there talking to a manager, Disney gave us the rest of our Park Hopper passes. Disney never received a fax from Expedia but lucky for us Disney honored my vouchers. It has now been 8 days since I spent over 3 hours dealing with that *** at the Happiest Place on Earth and I have NEVER received an email OR an inadequate $50 voucher from Expedia (but plenty of their email advertisements). Oh and by the way. The ground transportation I had from airport to hotel ALSO had no record of us in their system, but luckily I called them beforehand to confirm and they put us in their system. UPDATE: after numerous emails back & forth with their customer service dept. I called Expedia yesterday to get some kind of compensation for the inconvenience. On hold for 1 hour & told I would receive a credit to my credit card within 5 days. Got an email from Expedia tonight saying that Disney denied my request for a refund, therefore the case is closed. I never wanted a refund from Disney! They probably never even received the $900 Expedia charged me. What a joke.

All I have to say is avoid Expedia, unless you enjoy being on hold with customer service for 50 minutes before they even answer! I waited because I desperately needed to change my flight. Well, it certainly wasn't worth the wait and I was placed on hold for a another 20 minutes, then another 30--only to be told that I couldn't make the changes. I will never use them again and I will not EVER recommend them to any one I know and love. The customer ""service"" rep told me that she was on the phone with the airline after I asked her what took so long. In that case, I should have just called the airline myself. Avoid. Avoid.

The total package price to Kona, HI was approximately $3800.00.  I was booking and giving a form of payment.  I then received an error message that the outbound flight was unavailable and to please call their customer service to complete the booking or cancel the booking online.  I first attempted to call and the estimated wait time was 35 minutes, so I hit the cancel button.  I then attempted to rebook the package, but when I went to pay, I received an error message that my debit card was declined.  I checked my bank account and Expedia had placed a $2500.00 hold on my card!  I was like WTF and where did that unauthorized amount come from? I called Expedia, held for an hour, got a rep that said there must have been a glitch in the system and they would refund the hold.  They said I should see the money back in my bank within 24 hours.  This of course did not happen.  I called my bank, reported an unauthorized charge and the bank said it takes 3-5 business days to release the hold.  My bank is going to monitor the charge as disputed.  I swear if the charge goes through and the bank has to take further action for fraud, I am going to contact the Bellevue Washington police department and file a report.

After 5 hours on hold or of speaking to Expedia representatives, they finally put me thru to a supervisor. She put me on hold for about an hour and then the call miraculously disconnected and I have not been able to speak to a supervisor again.

I have made many hotel, flight and rental reservations through Expedia over the years.  I generally find what I want and book the reservation on line.  The only issue that I've ever had is arriving at a hotel to find that the smoking room that I had requested was not available.  Each time that this has happened, the hotel staff says that it had something to do with booking through a travel site rather than with the property directly. My most recent trip was a little different.  We were going to Gainesville, FL for surgery. I had some specific concerns about early check-in, pets, etc. and just wanted to talk to a person.  I dialed a phone number that appeared on the hotel's listing on Expedia that I mistakenly thought was a number to a Hilton central reservations number.  I should have realized when I started talking with someone who was clearly NOT in Atlanta or Dallas or where ever but was probably in a foreign country, that I was not talking to who I needed to be talking to.  Should have stopped right there, but I didn't.  My bad. After about 3 days and 15 phone calls to the number that I called, I STILL did not have a correct reservation and my credit card had been billed about three times as much as it should have been for nights that were not even in the same month as I was asking for.  AND they were trying to charge cancellation fees to correct THEIR errors!!   Among other things, I was told that there was a $65 per pet, per night pet fee which was billed to my card to the tune of $390.00 instead of the correct one time $65.00 fee for all 3 pets for my entire stay.   Every time that I asked to speak to a supervisor, I got a big run-around.  Was given the names of ""supervisors"" who would be in ""tomorrow at 10"" only to call back and find that nobody knew who I was talking about.  I also was told during one call that I had agreed to pay 4 cancellation fees to cancel 4 incorrect reservations that they made.  Why in the world would I agree to pay to change YOUR mistake, Expedia????   When I finally wised up and called the property directly, I learned that on two different occasions during my trying to straighten the mess out that the Expedia phone number people caused, the property had been contacted directly by Expedia and told that I had said things that I had never said.  One stated that I had said that I would call the property to cancel their erroneous reservations.  No, I never said that. The property also reported that the Expedia people said that I would be cancelling my credit card.  Well, if that would have fixed the problems caused by the Expedia people, I would have considered it. But of course, that wouldn't have fixed the problem AND I never said that!!!!     On top of all of the wrong/incomplete reservations and attempts at overcharging, the Expedia people sent maybe two of the promised 10 confirmation e-mails that were supposed to confirm their most recent attempt to get the reservation right.  And each time a call was made, they came up with a different ""reference number"" or ""confirmation number"", calling it a different name frequently.  Next time I'd get on the phone with them and give them the latest ""number"" that I had been provided with,  the person on the end of the phone would act like the number that I gave them didn't make sense.   In the end, I finally got Expedia to refund everything that they had charged to my credit card.  I had involved the credit card company and had started the dispute process but it turned out that Expedia did the right thing and credited the charges back.  But NOT without several days of wasted time, frustration and beating my head against the wall. Needless to say, I have learned NOT to attempt to speak with anybody at the phone number listed.  If you can'd do it on the Expedia site, then call the property/vendor directly.",booking"Expedia Flight Change Review from New York, New York. I booked a flight on Expedia and then called them to change it to a different date. I got a confirmation email both from Expedia and the airline. I show up to my flight and the airline says that Expedia changed my ticket except not really. They sent me an itenirary but their ticketing department hadn't really actually bought the ticket.  When I found this out my flight was well over an hour away from boarding. I called them right away to sort it out but they kept transferring me from one person to another. I missed that flight.  The Expedia rep said they wanted to get me to a hotel. I said there must be other flights they can get me to from other airlines. I am moving to the west coast so I had 3 very big and heavy suitcases and I was alone and female. Did not want to drag them around.  So I begged them to get me on another flight with a different airline.  They finally agreed but then kept transferring me to one another one of the reps said she wanted me to go to delta airlines and get on the 8:20pm flight. When she said this it was already 8:19pm. I told her that was ridiculous since the flight leaves in literally one minute. She put me on hold again to look at other options even though I told her I can tell her what the options are because I had it in front of me. At this point I Had already looked at the flights  on my phone and knew which ones I could still make so I went to the appropriate terminal and started to wait in line for a flight another flight an hour away at 9pm.  When she came back online the rep sleepily said she finally found a flight I could get on and surprise suprise it was the one I was already waiting in line for. I could have told her that 30 mins ago! She put me on hold again saying she was going to try to purchase a ticket for me.  By the time she came back on the line that flight had taken off too. At this point She said that she was going to put $200 in my Expedia account towards lodging for the night. She said she was gonna look for a hotel. I suggested her to change my reservation to tomorrow while I look for a hotel myself so that we can divide and conquer.  The cheapest hotel I could find that had a restaurant (I was starving at that point) was $258 so she made me pay the difference. I was so pissed this company was making even more money off of me as I gave her my credit card information. When I was asking questions about very simple things the rep started getting an attitude with me. After what I had been through her rudeness, I just couldn't take it anymore I had a nervous breakdown and hung up the phone before she could change the flight.  At this point I had been on the phone for exactly 2 and half hours at the airport. So I went to the hotel. I took a shower and called them back to change the flight. They again transferred me to 6 different agents before I was again in the hands of aWanda the super rude rep who had attitude as if she was the one who had to go through all that I went trough. Ive been on the phone with Wanda for the second time for 2 hours 8minutes  now as I write this and I'm still counting....",booking"No bags included with air travel.

The cost of paying for the baggage fees exceeded the total cost of my familys air travel for this leg.

I made a reservation for hotel starting on July 12 through the 13th upon arriving at the hotel I found that the hotel staff was very rude I contacted Expedia to see if I was able to cancel without being penalized they told me I could they also contacted the hotel to see if that was a possibility I never did ask them to cancel it I waited for 2 hours at the hotel with all of my stuff once I went to the window they told me that Expedia had canceled my reservation and that they were then fully booked I contacted Expedia once again they contacted the hotel on my behalf and I was sitting right there when the hotel told them once again the reservation was cancelled and they were fully booked so I not only spent $30 on a cab to get there I waited for 2 hours just to then have no room the mixup was clearly between Expedia and the hotel however when I contacted Expedia they told me that there was nothing that they can do to compensate me for my travel on top of that I had to travel again to another hotel which cost even more money I feel that I was treated poorly on both ends but based on the fact that I made my reservation through Expedia I would have expected them to compensate me in whatever way they can as their customer needless to say I will never book a reservation with them again.",booking"Terrible. We booked our trip to Bora Bora through Expedia. When we went to the airport, our flight was cancelled (from Pittsburgh to LA). No email from Expedia. An hour later received an email that our flight was cancelled (after the fact). The only way we could get to LA at the last minute was to take a flight to Philadelphia (going the wrong way).  We missed our connecting flight to Tahiti.  We didn't know if we could get another flight to Tahiti until we arrived in LA.  Expedia was zero help. They kept us on hold for over an hour. Since we missed our connecting flight, we lost out on our 200 dollar hotel room. Instead we were forced to fly the red eye, which I didn't want to do.  What a mess.

My card was charged instantly (that was the only thing that they�ve done really fast.)  Arrived at the hotel around 10pm exhausted after almost 20 hours overseas flights only to find out that the hotel doesn�t know about the booking. Spend good 30 minutes at the desk while receptionist was trying to get in touch with Expedia with no result. Thankfully she felt sorry for me and checked me in with no extra charge.   I called Expedia next day and wasted 30 minutes on waiting and then trying to explain situation to the employee who finally said he is sorry that he will apply coupon to my account but before doing that he need to consult his supervisor.  He put me on endless hold that was dropped in about half an hour. I waited some time foolishly hoping that they will call me back and then called myself again. Another 30 minutes wait and I need to explain the whole story again to another employee with hardly understandable English. This was like talking to the robot that was programmed to say just few phrases the short meaning of which was: not our fault� Apparently it�s normal for some hotels to receive booking confirmation after several hours the booking was fully paid.  How ridiculous is it? Anyway, I lost my patience and ended that fruitless conversation with the promise to delete Expedia apps from all my devises and never use their services again.",booking"Expedia promised airline seat upgrade. Poor Expedia Service: I want to share the dissatisfaction I recently have had with Expedia regarding a transaction. My wife & I recently booked a flight thru Expedia & after a couple of weeks we decided to up grade our seats to Economy Comfort. Since we booked the flight thru Expedia, the airline required we perform the upgrade thru Expedia. On June 29th, we called Expedia & performed the upgrade which was quoted at $100 for each seat. We provided the Expedia rep our credit card number & was told we would receive a confirmation email within 24 hrs. The call to Expedia lasted for 32 minutes & is documented thru our phone provider. Upon not receiving the confirmation email nor seeing upgraded seat assignments, we called Expedia to check on the transaction. We spoke to an Expedia service rep, a supervisor & finally a manager who informed us they had no record of our transaction. Unfortunately, we did not get a confirmation number for our transaction & Expedia is ultimately refusing to acknowledge that we even spoke to them even though our phone company has call records indicating the call to Expedia. I am very dissatisfied with Expedia & will not use their service in the future & I hope you will join me or least keep this bad experience in your mind when dealing with Expedia. For Expedia to completely deny any responsibility for the poor customer service in our transaction with their representative is less than acceptable...!!",booking"Do not use a third party like Expedia to rent a car!. What a rip off. I booked a car rental through Expedia and asked to reserve for Denver International airport. Upon arrival to the Enterprise counter at the airport, I was told that our car needed to be picked up in downtown Denver! Upon further notice my confirmation did say pick up at an address in Denver and drop off at Denver International. After a $75 cab ride to downtown Denver to get the car, I was told I would be charged $100 to drop off the car at the airport when clearly my confirmation says drop off at Denver International. Apparently this happens quite often.",booking"Left in the airport. I am high upset with what Expedia put me and son through, the day we arrived to our vacation location. It was my son first vacation and was the worse experience for him when we arrived to the Orlando Fl. i booked my flight, hotel and shuttle bus through Expedia hoping that i would not have to worry anything throughout our vacation. When we arrived to Orlando airport i went straight to the shuttle company that Expedia had booked for me and i paid for. I was informed by the employer of that vendor that their shuttle does not go to the hotel that I was booked in. i called Expedia to see what was going on. They keep me on hold for hours. I spoke to representative that informed me that can not do anything about it but just refund me the money. I then spoke to the manager Hector who told me that he can not do anything. i asked if they can change the vendor since they were the ones that picked a vendor that could not take me to my location. he informed me that he was not able to do that and he can only refund me the money.he then stated that he can have someone pick up the next day at the airport. He did not have no concern that a customer that trusted Expedia, was stuck in an airport with her 5 year son for hours, not knowing anything or anyone. I honestly felt that all they care about was that they got their money and they do not care about the safety of their customer. It was more like your on your own and the customer has to figure it out on their own. I then had to pay out of pocket for my son and I to get to the airport and back. Expedia does not care about they customers at all.",booking"Group booking mess. I tried to book a family trip for 7 pple. I called expedia, they gave me the number for group bookings, b/c the website only does up to 6 pple. I called the number, the rep coordinated flights and hotel by arranging 6 and 1 separately. After billing me for one flight, he tend told me, he couldn't book for the remaining 6! Transferred me to customer service, where they had no idea about why I was being transferred. Got transferred again to a supervisor who was finally able to reverse the charge on my visa. Was told that the rep wasn't a group res. person so he couldn't do the booking, and that I was given the wrong number. this was three solid hours on the phone, and I ended up with nothing, b/c the group sales office was closed!",booking"Charged an American Express card that isn't mine for reservation..

When my husband checked in at the hotel, he was told the reservation was charged to an American Express card (which we don't even have!), not the Visa I provided to the agent.  Very frustrating as the Expedia agent repeated the number back to me twice.  Which now requires me to call them back and get another person in India who took some time just to explain the issue to and another 30 minutes of my time!  Ridiculous.  Next time, I'll just call the hotel directly and probably get the same rate but will bypass Expedia.  This is truly ridiculous!!!!!",booking"Told hotel was pet friendly and was not.

They are quick to charge your credit card but it takes at least 5 days to credit your credit card.  When we attempted to call Expedia for a credit, it was an hour and a half phone wait.

I would like to share my experience  with Expedia from today, June 26. The saga actually begins this past Tuesday, June 23.  My wife attempted to make a reservation round-trip from Houston going overseas, with a departure date of July 8 and a return date of August 20.  Expedia proceeded to charge our Mastercard credit card and to book us for an itinerary with a departure date of July 8 and a return date of July 20.  When my wife realized she had been inexplicably  booked for a wrong return date, she asked me to handle it. I called Expedia and cancelled the reservation two hours after this erroneous booking was made, and I received a confirmation e-mail that the cancellation would be honored. This morning, June 26, my wife attempted to redo the reservation with Expedia.  When it came time to pay, she was told by Expedia that our credit card declined payment.  When we called Citicards, they told us we already had a pending charge from June 23 in the amount of $3,545, and that the attempt to charge the card for another $3,545 today was declined because it would exceed our credit limit. I called Expedia.  The rep told me to call Citicards.  I called Citicards.  Their rep told me to call Expedia.  Growing frustrated, I decided to conference in both Expedia and Citicards.  This is where things got bad.  The Expedia rep, a young lady, told me that it would require a wait period of eight weeks to get the $3,545 pending charge taken off our card.  I explained that this was bad for me, that we needed to make a reservation, and we couldn�t wait eight weeks, but that until the pending charges were removed, I would not be able to book the flight.  After some hemming and hawing from her, she decided to pass me on to Alvin, a young lad who first went through the whole damned story, reciting to me what I already knew, and then decided his version of things was that Air France had charged our card, and that Air France would need to authorize its removal.  I asked if he would be so good as to contact Air France, which he said he would.  When I suggested we conference in Air France to this nice little discussion, he said he could not, that he could only speak to the Air France rep on a separate line. He put me on hold for no longer than 15 seconds, just enough time to either really talk to an Air France rep or to add some cream to his coffee (that is, I am not really sure if there was any Air France rep on the other line), but at any rate, he said there was nothing Air France could do.  I told him this was no good for me,  that I needed this issue solved, etc, to which Alvin came up with the idea of putting me on hold in order for him to speak to his credit authorization department. Twenty minutes tick by, interspersed, at first fairly frequently, and with heartfelt enthusiasm by Alvin, assurances   that he was really really sorry for the wait, and that he sure did appreciate my patience, but  these assurances proceeded to occur at wider intervals.  An uneasy period of silence�   And then, suddenly, yet another Expedia rep. The new Expedia rep was Chad, who asked how he could help me.  So we needed to start all over.  Whatever became of the credit authorization department, I will never know.  Once again I explained my situation, and once again it was recited to me in parrot-like fashion, this time by Chad, the details of  the sordid story that I already knew.  Chad, a supervisor, apparently decided he didn�t need to listen to my story, like his underlings, for Chad actually hung up on me. This was even better than the fact that my next Expedia contact, Angel, instructed me that he would not permit me to demonstrate any level of hostility.  Angel was also a supervisor.  So he�s obviously moving up in the world.  I will be brief and simply state that Angel manifested consistency, when compared to his Expedia colleagues, in terms of helpfulness, clarity, and general evidence of cerebral activity. I didn�t feel so bad when my wife told me she had been hung up on twice.  She spent the first half of this day in similar discussions with Expedia reps, who either gave rambling answers or contradicted themselves and their colleagues, but who in each case steered clear of any solution to the matter.  Mingled in were repeated, overused scripted inserts of   �I�m very sorry to hear that,� �I understand your frustration,� and �I�ll do all I can to resolve this to your satisfaction.�  I am not sure who writes their stuff, but they need to jazz it up a little.  They sound really over-rehearsed. My wife finally did manage to resolve this, mostly at the helpful suggestions of Citicard, so we are back to square one, which is that we have our money back, and have no reservation.  I never knew how good it felt to be back to square one.   We still need to go ahead and book this flight so my wife may see her mother overseas for the first time in three years.  Guess who we are NOT using to book the flight?",booking"Still waiting for Expedia to answer. I have been trying to straighten out my bundle trip to Maui as Expedia had placed an extra charge to my return flight and then they never booked seats for 2 of my flights and now they refuse to talk to me to get resolution. I have sent e-mails and their response is we will get back to you with-in 24 hours and when I do call all I get is I understand your problem but I can not do anything for you. Then when asked to be connected I am left on hold for hours and transferred around to so called supervisors whom can hardly speak English so much as to understand it. I would never recommend anyone to use Expedia to book their vacation unless you enjoy bad booking, no customer service as their policy is to get your money and if there is a problem fix it yourself.",bookingAirline Tickets Review.

I reserved a hotel in Mendoza, Argentina on Expedia.com. I received a confirmation, room was charged to my credit card but then I receivd an email informing me that the hotel could not accept my reservation. I called the number provided but over a two day period I was put on hold for over 2 hours. I pay my cell phone by the minutes, so I was very disappointed when I finally spoke to someone who tried to help me, I was offered a ""comparable"" accommodation that was more than twice the price of the original hotel. I made other arrangements through booking.com Expedia failed me miserably and I am extremely disappointed.",bookingAll Inclusive Travel Package Review. Don't fall for Expedia's all inclusive resort trap! That's what we thought we purchased for Aruba and we found out that was not the case when we arrived. We are stuck in a resort now with limited and very expensive dining options. We have been on the phone for 2 days to get a hold of customer service but no luck. That's the last time I'm shopping for vacation from Expedia. What a disappointment.,booking"Luggage Review from Pool, England. Booked honeymoon tickets to south korea this summer,  needed extra luggage so purchased the deal with option for additional luggage at small FIXED fee.  Took me 5 WEEKS  to get hold of customer service to try to pay for this extra luggage, at the end,  I got told by Expedia that it is not possible so I just have to pay for whatever the airlines have to charge me at the airport. Ticket is not refundable of course,  so I just have to purchase another ticket elsewhere, or gamble my luck at the airport.  There is only one winner in this situation,  the one that pocket my money and think it is justifiable.",booking"booking Review from Adelaide, South Australia. I have used Expedia to book overseas holidays for years. This time however was an absolutely appalling experience. I will never ever ever ever use Expedia again.  Every single flight we booked was incorrect. When rectifying the flights the phone calls to customer service were extremely painful. I was on hold for 30 minutes. The customer service person was rude and disinterested. After being on the phone to her for over 20 minutes she told me I would have to call back another time as she was having to wait too long on hold to the airline. I then had to call back at a later time (in order to rectify THEIR problem) and explain the entire scenario again. Our flights were then rebooked.  To our disgust, when checking into the flights we were told the flights didn't match up and we wouldn't even have enough time to transfer planes. Expedia had rebooked us onto flights that they knew would never work. This left us stranded in Mexico. This happened several times throughout our holiday, almost making us miss our own wedding at one point. Just DISGUSTING! I will NEVER use Expedia again. I complained and recieved a generic email in response. Very poor.",bookingIncorrect reservation and no customer service support. BUYER BEWARE:  Confirmed reservation came through with incorrect dates and incorrect room type.  Called Expedia and they advised to talk to hotel (no changes/cancellation reservation) since it was their policy.  Talked to hotel who agreed to same rate for the change to thecorrect date.  Called Expedia CS Mgr back who advised that for the date I wanted there would be a rate increase by $18.43 since reservation was first booked (less than an HOUR before).  Would not accept old hotel rate.  CLASSIC BAIT AND SWITCH for a garbage booking system and equally useless Customer (NON) Service.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,booking"Lack of cooperation between Expedia and airlines. Because I used Expedia, the inexperienced Jetblue agent could not produce a boarding pass and flight change in sufficient time, when I realized upon going through security that I printed my receipt and not the boarding pass because Expedia website is a busy mess.  She locked her system, needed help from others, 30 precious minutes wasted as I was trapped at ticket counter and unable to get boarding pass.  No kiosks for Expedia or Jetblue at DCA, no helpful available agents, and she refused to call gate agent and let me rush to get thru security at 6 am and caused me to miss my flight!  I was there in sufficient time, had no luggage.  Just needed the darn boarding pass.  Also because expedia does not issue email reminders like the airlines do about flight check in or EASY, CLEAR, QUICK ability to produce boarding passes, it contributed to the whole debacle that resulted in my missing my flight and now fighting to get my money refunded.  I could not find my flight on the Jetblue site so was unable to generate a boarding pass from there.  I will NEVER use Expedia again.  This happened to me once previously when gate agents were quick to dismiss ticket changes when a flight got cancelled and relegate me to the very bottom of the pile when it came to rebooking.",booking"booking Review from Gilbert, Arizona. Buyer beware. This service provided knowing that no refunds or changes can be made means any mistake, yours or otherwise means they have your money and you have nothing. No customer service, no recourse. And they know it. A model that will self destruct as soon as anyone else provides a product backed by service like what Southwest did for airlines.  I got screwed out of my money because of the difficulty of inputting into a smart phone the data needed to book a reservation for that evening but the computer kept changing the date. Their policy is absolutely no changes or refunds. Call your credit card company and dispute the charge. Look on Expedia then call the hotel direct, NEVER book thru Expedia. You get the same or better deal booking direct plus changes and refunds are available",booking"3 weeks, 19 phone calls, 5 supervisors and 12 hours of MY TIME!!. 1. Flying from Dominican Republic to Antigua then on to London 2. One of my 3 fights was cancelled so I had to call EXPEDIA to reschedule the DR to Antigua flight. 3. I kept getting disconnected and each time I called back I could not speak to the same person so with every call I had to go through the automated process and re-explain my situation. 4. Eventually, after 3 weeks, 19 phone calls, 5 supervisors and 12 hours of my time I re-book the flight BUT 3 days earlier, because during the 3 weeks I had been trying to re-book, all of the flights had been taken. 5. So now I have my flight but have lost 3 days of my holiday and I now have to find another hotel in Antigua for the 3 days lay-over. 6. EXPEDIA compensated me by way of a $200 EXPEDIA coupon to redeem against the new booking so I follow the procedure to do this and GUESS WHAT?!?!?!?!?! The $200 coupon doesn't redeem against the $882 total of my new booking. 7. Back on the phone to Expedia who tell me that as I have booked the last available room at the hotel they cannot cancel and re-book it because the system will not allow it. They can offer me a different room or a different hotel, however it will take 2 weeks for me to get my refund on my credit card. Then the inevitable happens, I get disconnected after almost an hour on the telephone. They return my call but only for 1 ring, just enough that they can say they returned my call, and short enough that I don't get a chance to answer it! (this happened 5 times previously) 8. I have exhausted every single ounce of patience that I have. I cannot call them back again as I am getting no nearer in amending my credit card payment or redeeming the $200 coupon they gave me. 9. The whole process has caused me so much upset and cost me so much time and money that I NEVER want to use this site again. 10. I have wasted too much of my time on this ONE TRIP which has now cost me 12 hours of my time and an extra $882 but on the bright side I still have a $200 coupon to use on my next trip. Hilarious!!!",booking"Booked Flight That Did Not Exist. I was stranded at the Madrid airport as the connected flight from Newark to Malaga Spain booked through Expedia simply did not exist.

We had to beg Iberia to take pity on us and allow us to jump on their next flight 10 hours later. This completely consumed Day 1 of a 7 day vacation and also stranded my young daughter in Malaga, Spain (as she had a different flight through Germany on my United miles and I was supposed to be there waiting 2 hours in advance of her flight.

I have been in a back and forth process with Expedia since Nov. 2014. Extremely unhappy with the service!. AVOID USING EXPEDIA AT ALL COST!!!  December 2014, my grandfather passed away and I had to cancel two flights that I had booked with Expedia prior (November 2014). I notified expedia right away and was told I would be issued a refund or credited for my ticket once I submitted the necessary documents(death certificate)implementing their extenuating circumstances policy. In January of 2015 I contacted expedia and spoke with a representative in regards to the status of my case. They informed me that I would need to wait a little longer-so I did! In early February 2015, I contacted expedia once again to inquire about my status. Again, another representative told me the same thing, wait a little longer. Towards mid February after noticing no changes to my bank account I contacted expedia again. This time they told me I should wait sometime longer because sometimes it takes more than two billing cycles to be reimbursed. In March, after waiting near three months I contacted expedia once again. After placing me on hold (as they usually did time and time again) the agent returned to the phone and informed me that I would not be receiving a refund due to the airlines rules and policy. Keep in mind this was after I was verbally promised a refund by the agent once I submitted the necessary documents. Although I was extremely frustrated with the misleading of information, constant back and forth I replied, ""ok, how about a credit of some sort"", once again the representative placed me on hold in order to communicate with her supervisor. My phone call was suddenly disconnected. After calling back and repeating the events to date (as always, because it seemed like they had insufficient notes) I was placed on hold for literally an hour. I refused to hang up and just held on. When the agent came back on, he said they were unsuccessful in contacting the airlines and a supervisor will call me back as soon as they contacted the airlines. No one ever called me back, I waited three days  then called expedia again. And the pattern continued up until April. In April, an agent informed me that I would in fact receive a credit but had until November 2015 to use it. She said she made a note of the information. When I asked for an email she said everything was set and that the conversation had been recorded therefore, she didn't need to provide me with an email. I thanked her and hung up. Based on the information I received from the agent, I decided to request time off from my job in July and made the necessary arrangements and reservations for accommodations for my travels. I also purchased two separate flights that would enable me to use the airline credit I was given without any complications. Yesterday, May 27th, I called expedia to reserve my flight using the credit they had issued  and  I was denied that request. I spoke with two agents and then a supervisor(Jessica). The first agent, I had gotten disconnected with (as usual). The second agent gave me what he said was a confirmation number for my credit and told me I had to call the airlines directly to purchase my flight because the airline hadn't released the funds back to expedia. After calling the airlines, the airline representative seemed confused as to why the agent would give such instructions. Of course, I had to call expedia once again. I requested to speak directly to a manager, who informed me that I wasn't provided with a credit confirmation code because it was in fact a case code that the agent had provided me with. She said her representative could not have told me I had a credit without an email. I was furious! I asked her to listen to the conversation between that representative and I when we spoke in April. She said the only thing I could do was make a complaint and she could no longer be of any assistant. This is the WORST, UNRELIABLE customer service I have ever received. I am now left with seven days off, a booked hotel and car rental and two tickets that I was suppose to use to connect to my intended flights that I am no longer credited for. How unethical and unjust? For the past six months I have been dealing with a lot of incompetence and negligence (Expedia employees). HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! Won't ever use this company again, even if I have to pay double the price for tickets or hotels with another!",booking"booking Review from Houston, Texas. Last night we tried booking a mexico vacation through Expedia, and after giving our card information were told there was an error. Long story short, they went ahead and extracted the amount due for our trip and flight (obviously thousands of dollars) and got nothing in return. No reservations, no airline tickets. After calling costumer service and being put on hold and passed around to different ""customer service representatives"" we finally talked to a supervisor of a supervisor telling us that they don't know what went wrong, but we should try to apply for a refund because they took almost 3000 dollars out of our account. I asked to be transfered to someone in that branch and abruptly hung up on. Tried calling back and after another 45 minutes got no answer. I sent two emails and tried calling an alternate number and no one has contacted me. So we had to cancel our cards after Expedia drew out $1600 (the trip was $2700 so??????) luckily our bank is disputing the charges from Expedia. I am appalled at the lack of professionalism and cannot believe how unhelpful your customer service people are. Posting here is last resort because all options from your website (phone numbers, email, etc.) have been exhausted.",booking"Expedia changed my flight, claimed they notified me, they did not.. I booked a round-trip flight from Philadelphia to Key West for my brother's wedding in May of 2015. The flight down was cancelled by the airline, I had to contact Expedia to get a new flight which got me to Key West late with a long layover. Fine, inconvenient, but tolerable. On the way home, I went to check in for my flight, which I found had been changed from 11:30am to 7am and no one had notified my. My evening plans, transfer to the airport, all ruined. I called Expedia, where they told me I had authorized these changes the month before. I did not. After going up several chains of command, with 3 hours of my time wasted on the phone and several very rude customer service representatives, I got to the ""supervisor's supervisor"". He very rudely told me that I approved the changes the month before (I did not) and that I had been notified (I was not). He told me I would have to pay $200 change fee since it was my fault, and then raised his voice to me and said they couldn't help me anyway I would have to call the airline. I called a travel agent friend of mine, who was able to go through Expedia and get my flight changed back. So clearly, Expedia can make the changes if you use the right words, but for us average patrons they refuse to, they just want the money for the change fee. Incredibly poor customer service, I will not use Expedia for a flight ever again.",booking"Horrible customer service. It was horrible customer service.

I'm in a *** hotel that is dirty and just nasty found a used Crack pipe and a haft smoked joint I have a 2 way mirror above my sink and the floor have no been cleaned for a week that I know of,booking"Expedia Flight No rebooking or rerouting with 12 hrs HOLD TIME. SO I got a flight for BNA to MNL and paid for it before. However in the airport, I got my bags checked in and my boarding pass issued - meaning I'm already in and ready to fly. But due to the traffic in TSA checkpoints, I missed my flight. Now, it should be a prerogative of a reputable company such as EXPEDIA to provide rerouting or rebooking on a immediate manner in accordance with the policy. The whole scenario was accidental, and the customer is not at fault for missing that flight, PLUS I got a proof that I'm checked in because I HAVE MY BOARDING PASS. Unfortunately, after I missed the flight, DELTA airlines was much obliged to help me reroute but due to EXPEDIA being my travel ticket provider, I need to call EXPEDIA instead and have it reroute for me to DELTA and PAL. So, I thought the nightmare has ended, I was wrong.... it just started - I kept on calling EXPEDIA for almost 12 hours already! 12 *** HOURS! for a rerouting of my flight. With almost 20+ agents and 4 supervisors, they couldn't book one single reroute for BNA to MNL? How hard could that be? well, other than the fact I was on hold for 12 hours, I also missed the opportunity to get an earlier flight later that day because of their incompetent customer service (always on Hold, then when you get disconnected, you will have to start another booking inquiry) and their going back and forth to PAL and DELTA to have DEAL they said. I was left in the dark literally because I am still at the airport 1130 PM!, and the DELTA personnel still didn't help me either. BECAUSE EXPEDIA SAID THEY WILL COORDINATE WITH DELTA, and I was foolish to believe that. Imagine, they even booked a rerouting for SFO to MNL later on, BUT WITHOUT the flight from BNA to SFO. On which case they cancelled the flight themselves, so another ""not the customer's fault""  scenario happened again. I have proof of everything, their rerouting incompetence because I have a copy of the error they made for SFO and BNA. Then I also have m boarding pass saying that this is not a ""no show"". So as far as consumer rights is concerned, there should be a protection for us consumers about this unscrupulous policies that deny our right for compensation or refund if such accidental things happen. Isn't that why we have a compensation regulation? isn't it also the reason why WE HAVE TO BE REROUTED IMMEDIATELY once we missed our flight? That was the policy! So they broke it themselves and did not do their due for their bargain. Is it still the fault of the customer? Absolutely, NOT. That's why I filed a complaint already, and now also have a dispute with my card that I used. Because even my card representative said that this is NOT RIGHT because the ticket wasn't even used and now they will also leave their customer up in air. GOOD JOB EXPEDIA, we'll just see how FTC looks this up. *** I HAVE MY BOARDING PASS, BAGGAGE SLIP, ITINERARY CHANGES THAT DELTA AND EXPEDIA MADE, as a proof of their lack of consideration for fair customers like us. I hope somebody could help me out, but now, I'm on my way to another flight with a $1,091 additional ticket. My finances are now ruined because of expedia. I hope you have a goodnight sleep for all of this mess you did with a customer.",booking"Dishonest billing practices. BEWARE DO NOT USE EXPEDIA.  I have 2 on-going problems with Expedia and I advise everyone not to use them:  first, when booking flight tickets with them, twice they have blocked far more money on my credit card than the value of the flight (over 1500 USD more each time). When I called, I was quickly told it was a ""deposit"" in case I damaged the hotel room.  I responded that I did not book a hotel.  I was then told it was in case I damaged the rental car.  I did not book a rental car--only flight tickets. I was then told to contact my credit card company to show them ""proof"" that too much money had been blocked.  I spent quite a bit of time doing this and sent them the proof.  They simply never answered. After several customer service calls--each time being told the same useless information, I was finally told by one honest customer service representative that this is systematic with them and they will ""hold"" the money for 3 weeks and then give it back.  He said the only thing to do was to wait it out.  And in fact that is what happened--3 weeks later my money was released.  So they are apparently doing this systematically--giving themselves a free float at the cost of consumers--as during that time, I could not use my credit card as they had ""maxed it out"". Secondly, when booking another small flight ticket (100 euros), they charged an additional fee of 3 euros to me and tried to claim it was charged by the airline company.  I confirmed both with the airline company and my credit card and both confirmed that this extra charge was made by Expedia.  They refuse to refund me (I know the amount is small, but it represents 3% of the transaction and was NOT AUTHORISED by me).  They refuse to answer me and they cannot give me any further info.

I've now called Expedia who say it's my fault for not calling them within the first 28 days of the booking. Fair enough IF it weren't for the fact that they charged me �120 for a booking they never made. As far as I can tell, this is outright theft.

Never and I mean NEVER again will I do any business with expedia. Their customer service is Non existent, if not insulting.

He said that fine, he would do it but the price he quoted was $80 more than showed up on the website.  He would not change or offer a voucher of anything.  I finally gave up.  No tickets yet...  Ridiculous and unpleasant hour and a half!!!!",booking"Contacting the Expedia Partner Site. I booked a hotel thru an Expedia partner. I never received an email confirmation. I called the hotel & was told they had the reservation but the only had it listed as an Expedia Partner. I called Expedia 2 times, after much searching they connect me to ""partner"" could not give me name of partner. The number they connected me to was a conference bridge number that disconnected me. The 3rd phone call to expedia after being on hold for 18 min I was ""accidentally"" disconnected. I also tried to use their website where customer service calls you. They called me 3 times with no one on the line.  It was just awful.",booking"Lack of communication. Booked a hotel for stay in Sorrento, IT by way of Estonia (summer 2015). Twelve hours prior to departure from Estonia to Italy I received an email from Expedia stating that my reservation was cancelled. Needless to say I immediately panicked having planned the trip months in advance and recognizing the spiked prices summer travels to Europe presents. I contacted the hotel directly, very pleasant, they informed me that they informed Expedia of their closure in lieu of renovation several months in advance. Finally spoke with someone from Expedia after being looped around for an hour...they told me to find my own arrangements and minimized their oversight. I'm still waiting for my reimbursement :-(",cancellation"Expedia reservation Review from Phoenix, Arizona.

Booked tickets for my son to return to Zurich on Jan 12 with Swiss airlines (booking ref number:5JHTD3), received call 4 days before departure to tell me the airline dishonoured the booking ! How could that be possible???? Agent admitted his mistake and ultimately forced to buy a completely new set of tickets via Etihad airline (itinerary 125922384645 UESCFV) for January 10! Made several attempts and hours of waiting on hold before I was told I would receive a miserable refund of $6000 in 10-12 weeks time! I have paid over $12000 in total for a returned tickets that should cost 7000+! Why should I be paying for the agent's mistake???? No apology, no explanation for the mistake and cancellation, no follow up. I demand a freaking god *** reason and compensation from Expedia!!! Ms Foo clo Julian Tiplady",cancellationBad experience. We made a reservation for a hotel through expedia by mistake. We found out the mistake in less than 5 minutes as called expedia immediately to cancel it. The reservation has a no refund tag. Expedia called the hotel but could not get thrugh. It promised to give us an update within 48 hours which never came. We called the hotel trying to cancel it. The hotel would not do it either. We offer to find other guests for the room and they still would not do it. We think this is very bad and unreasonable business practice.,cancellation"Customer Care Review from New York, New York. The absolute worst customer service I have ever received. Spoke to 3 different reps about an issue, all of them gave me different answers, after keeping me on hold for more than 20 minutes at a time. A note: don't brag about not charging cancellation fees when the airline charges them anyway!!!! It's still a cancellation fee - doesn't matter who is charging it. It does not make your service look more attractive when you brag about having no cancellation fee, then wright in fine print that you'll in fact be hit with cancellation fees. There are so many horrible reviews of Expedia customer service all over the Internet; I wish I listened. It's clear this company does not care about fixing it. It's a shame because I love the site and have been using it seamlessly for more than five years. Never again.",cancellation"Cancelled flights. Has all my flights cancelled by expedia ..

During the first part of our week long road trip learned that we could not go to Chico, so I called the motel and cancelled our stay. They informed me it was taken care of.

But wow, when there is a problem?  Any good feelings that you have about the company evaporate quicker than you can say ""we are experiencing a high volume of calls at present"".  Even when you personally have arranged with the hotel for a cancellation/refund,  trying to get Expedia customer service to process this correctly is extremely difficult.  I had to spend [no joke], a total of 3 hours on the phone and numerous emails to cancel the booking, only to find out a week later that they had not cancelled the flights, despite a very long drawn out conversation and being put on hold whilst customer service cancelled said flights.   So all in all, one of the worst experiences I have encountered; Ryanair would have fared better.  So my advice is that if the booking is certain and there will be no changes, go ahead, it will be fine.  But be warned.  Any changes/cancellations/refund requests and suddenly blood from a stone would be easier.",cancellation"Tour Booking Review from Singapore, Singapore. Booked a tour with grayline australia - bayron bay tour. Tour cancelled and informed me less than 12hours before tour actual day.

I called customer service to cancel or change my flight, the first agent was understanding and she talked to the airlines to see if i could change the flight, she transferred me to one of the supervisors who is supposed to give me the fee pricing but the call got disconnected, so i call again, and the agent redirected me to an other supervisor which is a guy this time, telling him that i want to change the flight but he said that its not possible and he just hung up on me. worst customer service ever. so i basically wasted 3 hours of my life over nothing. just waiting on hold and checking the phone if it got disconnected or anything, but this *** just doesn't want to help and hung on me?! plus i told him that he isn't helping me one bit and i wanted to talk to another agent but he wouldn't transfer me just saying its not possible to change it. thanks for calling and goodbye and i told him wait I'm not finished and don't hung up on me he got quiet for a few seconds then just hung up.",cancellation"Expedia Cancellation Policy Review from Denver, Colorado. I wish I could give them 0 stars. I called last night and spoke with Tom at cuts service. I advised him that I needed to cancel my hotel Rez because of some financial hardships: he said he would contact the hotel to get approval for the cancel and that someone would call me today. That never happened so I called them again and they apparently have NO record of my call. Then they tell me the SAME thing, that they will have to call me back tomorrow. I requested a supervisor and he said the same so I requested his supervisor and she said she was corporate office... She said she had to get approval from the hotel and that the person they needed to speak with was not there (how convenient). She told me that *i* needed to call back tomorrow around 8am because Expedia doesn't do outbound calls very well... She said she was ""setting my expectation""... And what is that? A very low expectation that my issue wasn't important enough to call me back and take care of me. She was rude and not helpful. So here I am, having to wait another day to call again myself because they can't follow up with me on their own. I will NEVER use this company again.",cancellation"NEVER AGAIN. Went to cancel a reservation well in advance of the cut-off date.  Expedia insisted it wasn't booked through them and kept sending me to hotel.com, who kept sending me back to Expedia (after long wait times on the phone with each of course).  Finally, about 1:00 AM, Expedia ""found"" my reservation they had spent all night denying that I had in spite of both Hotel.com and the motel saying it was through them.  NEVER will use them again.  Not worth the hours spent with their worthless, foreign, customer service department.  I repeated asked them to contact the motel directly to straighten it out, but they refused.",cancellation"booking Review from Naperville, Illinois. It's ashamed how when an emergency happens to make a change on flights they can't at least waive the change/cancellation fee due to a death in the Family or even try to help me With something that can help me arrive. And I'm always using this company for business. It's not like I'm cancelling my flight I just need a sooner date to departure so I won't be missing the funeral. This is really sad that I can afford the fee and the difference of another ticket.",cancellation"Never again Expedia. Terrible experience. Had to change my ticket and it took almost an hour to get through the process. So the price changed from the time I started until the time the call ended by $70. Expedia would not eat the charges. Passed it on to their now ex-customer. customer service repeated ""I'm sorry"" about a hundred times but it is really quite meaningless when they do nothing to rectify the situation. It is frustrating enough to have to pay $200 to change the flight (which goes to the airlines) but then to have another $70 added on top of the price quoted at the beginning of the call in unacceptable.",cancellation"NO interest in a complaint and no service!. Booked a trip with the intended return date more than 12 months out from time of booking which the systems can't cater for so they provide the latest available date and in cases like ours should have notified the airline who would have made notes to allow us to change the date when it became available in the system at no charge, but they didn't. We have done this without problem in the past. When we later attempted to amend the return date expedia said after MANY phone calls and HOURS on the phone and MANY emails the airlines don't do this which simply ***. I eventually contacted British Airways, Zagreb office and they fixed it NO PROBLEM so compliments to the BA staff in Zagreb they were GREAT. The attempts to contact expedia via email was an exercise in frustration and the replies basically said ""Get Stuffed"". SRU from NZ",cancellation"Customer Care Review from New Delhi, Delhi. Extremely poor customer support.. On 6th July 2015 I was trying to check the final price and any promotional discount offers for booking, when I was asked for booking details. Since all the information was saved in my chrome it was filled using autofill function including my credit card details. When we were prompted for details, thought that's for account creation and entered that. Since the intention was to only check the total charge and not to book we cancelled the booking immediately as we did not authorize this transaction. Only then did we realize the amount was straight away charged to my credit card without any password authorisation. This was really strange as I have never come across anything like this before. I was sure of a pleasant experience with Expedia.co.in given the international standards and expected a quick resolution for this error. However, when I called customer care executive (Ms Ravinder Kaur) informed me that the full amount cannot be refunded as the booking was confirmed. This is a big security failure as code printed on my card cannot be used for secure authentication purpose. Please note that the booking was cancelled within less than a minutes of confirming as it was completely unintentional. I have sent several emails since 6th July 2015 until today to their email address but there was only one response received on 12th July 2015 mentioning they will revert within48-72 hours but response has been received. Request you to kindly help in getting the full amount refunded.",cancellation"Hotel cancellation delay 24 to 48 hours 2X REALLY??. I made a business reservation with Expedia for 3 nights in Logan Utah. They immediately charged my card for the 3 nights. OK I guess this is how they do it so I went with it. Upon arrival to my hotel I realized I only needed 2 nights so I let the receptionist know this. She told me I will need to take this up with Expedia. ""Just call them and they will credit the 3rd night"". I immediately went to my room and called Expedia Customer Support. I spoke to man with an Indian accent. I could hardly understand him and it seemed he could not understand me. While I was on hold he called the hotel where I was staying to confirm I will only be there 2 nights. He got back on the line with me and said he confirmed with the hotel and made several notes and will provide the information to the ""Credit Department"". He said this will take 24 to 48 hours to process and I will get an email to confirm. This made me feel as if I'm talking to the wrong department but I had no choice. Now a day after I checked out of my room I received an email receipt for the THREE DAYS! So I called customer support again. I spoke to a woman with a Spanish accent. Even harder to understand! She took my info as if it was new information and again said it will take 24 to 48 BUSINESS HOURS for me to get the credit for the 3rd day. She admitted she sees notes that I had called already days before but there was no response. She said she will escalate this to the ""higher team"". I asked if I can just talk to the ""higher team"" and she said they don't have phones????? This day and age you cannot provide an immediate credit??? She kept saying ""So you agree""? I kept saying no I do not agree and I want my credit now! Nothing she could do and I'm still waiting for my credit!

I booked some reservations for the FIRST time with this agency.

They say NO CANCELLATION. AFTER about 6 house of listening to their marketing junk, I called the hotel, the manager was good enough to allow the cancellation for $15.00 for one trip, and charge only the 1st day for another trip cancellation--which was fair.

I will never book with Expedia again (first and last time) Here is my original Itinerary number 1156239852635. After receiving an email saying pack your bags your going on vacation, Me and my GF went to the airport to find out we weren't on the flight we had booked to San Juan PR. We were supposed to arrive in San Juan PR at 5:15 AM on February 26th, 2017. Instead I was told by Air Canada I was not on the flight because Expedia cancelled my flight, and never advised me. I spent 6 horrible hours on the phone with 3 ppl, the 2 first being completely un-helpfull, not giving a *** about my situation, and at least Blake Andrews (who deserves a promotion), cause he's the only one that I felt like he cared. I booked with expedia on Jan 5, 2017, and Air Canada informed me that Expedia cancelled my flight Jan 6, 2017, and never advised me. The Air Canada agent told me that this happens with expedia quite often. NICE! When I asked Expedia what you can do about this, I was told the only time I can get to San Juan was at 2:20PM instead of 5:15 AM, where now I would have to run to catch a ferry to Vieques, which I just made, but I had to move my activities around because I was going to be late for my Bio Bay tour in Vieques. Already that I have a limited amount of time for my vacation, and everything was scheduled, to loose pretty much one day, because of who knows what. I was never given a proper explanation why this happened, is unacceptable. Not only did Expedia get me there later then I was supposed to, they put me on with Delta, not with Air Canada which was who I booked with, and I had to pay for our bags to get on the plane ($50). I spent 6 hours in the airport until Blake told me I can stay at a hotel with a 200$ voucher he can give me. I slept 2-3 hours and had to leave to get back to the airport, no shuttle at this time (2AM) to be on time to catch my new 5am flight to Atlanta. Also the only way I can get this voucher was to be a full Expedia Member, and not a temp. Excuse me but YOU messed up Expedia not me, and the only real thing I got was a freaking 200$ voucher at some hotel, and I had to be full Expedia member, I never want to be associated with Expedia ever again. I asked what are you going to do for making me loose some of my vacation, having a horrible 6 hour experience on the phone, I was told there isn't really anything expidia can do then just try to get me there asap. All in all it was a horrible/stressful start to my vacation, and during my entire trip I explained to everyone what happened, and trust me they will be scared to use expedia. It's just unbelievable/unacceptable to do this to a traveler. To take my money and say I'm booked, and be shocked when I arrive at the airport, just makes me cringe, and blast Expedia All day Everyday. I will be posting this on Facebook, and trip advisor, and sending you my bills for bag costs with Delta ($50), airport food costs ($30) for spending 6 hours on the phone at YUL airport (I should charge you time at 50$/ hour), taxi cost to get us from the hotel to the airport (25$). It would be nice to hear from someone concerning this, and what can be done for making me loose a day of my vacation over who knows what happened at Expedia.

I spend literally all day for 2 days on hold with Expedia. United was willing to change everything and they suggested I talk to a higher up at Expedia to cancel the reservation.

The Halloween event we were attending was canceled because Hurricane Matthew is fast approaching. Orlando and the surrounding area is under mandatory evacuation.  I am simply trying to cancel my reservation.  I attempted to cancel through the hotel; however, because I booked through Expedia, I was told I cannot by a representative of Lowe's, the owner of Cabana Bay.

We booked a trip to Highlands for a wedding; after bone infection found in foot, we had to cancel plans. The hotel found no reservation, but tried to help with cancellation. They called me three times looking to help with the problem. This is 16 days before the arrival date. The hotel really wanted to help, but said I needed to contact Expedia. They claimed the hotel refused the refund, yet this is a lie. They sent back a standard reply of non-refundable; even though our doctor would gladly speak or send proof of the surgery. This is a medical emergency; bone infection is lethal. So they said call this customer service #404-728-8787, the hold would be 2 minutes; it is 30 minutes and I am still holding.

This was the worst experience I have ever had with booking travel.  I booked through Expedia about 2 months ago and was notified that there was a schedule change and I had to contact them.  I spent 8 hours on the phone, spoke to at least 6 agents and 2 supervisors.  An airline cancelled one of my flights and I was told that unless I left a day earlier or later (and I could not) that I would have to pay for the other leg of my trip.  While I did not make any change myself, I was told I still had to pay hundreds of dollars.  Often it was difficult to understand the people from other part of the world and until I spoke to the very last person, no one really showed that they cared and often gave rote responses.  I was disconnected, people said they would get back to me and did not.  Only after complete persistence did I finally find someone willing and wanting to help.  This was just terrible!",cancellation"Expedia lies to its customers. My daughter booked a flight through Expedia. A company rep called to report that  American Airlines had canceled the flight. Rather than discussing various options, the Expedia rep pressured her into taking a flight with a longer layover. After she hung up, I immediately called back to ask about changing to a better flight. The first rep kept me on hold for an hour, then said the desired flight was available; however, I would have to speak to another rep to book it. The second rep kept me only hold for another hour, only to say that he had talked directly to American Airlines, which informed him that the desired flight had only first-class seats available, and that it would cost $300 to change. I hung up and immediately called AA directly. They told me there were seats available on the desired flight, and that no fee would be assessed. So the Expedia rep told a bald-faced lie.

Expedia cancelled the flight without any reason, and we did not get a phone call nor email. We called Asiana Airline, their agents said ""Expedia did not link the Ticket with the Reservation, therefore, the Expedia cancelled the flight"". We called Expedia, the first agent's name is ""Alex"", he said ""you have to pay $200 for cancellation"". We said ""we did not cancel the flight, Expedia cancelled it. Why are you charging us for your mistake?"" Then Alex said that our credit card company decline the payment, so Asiana Air cancelled the flight. We called Asiana again, they said ""no, we did not cancel your flight. We got the money. It is Expedia that cancelled your flight, your ticket is still valid"". We called Expedia again, we waited for over 40min and got a supervisor named ""Carl"" got on the phone, who kept on saying""I understand, but it is Asiana Airline""s Policy, they will charge $200 fee"". We said ""Expedia cancelled the flight, Expedia should pay for it!"" Carl said ""OK, let me get my supervisor"". We waited for over 60min, someone took over the phone, and he hang up.  We started to call Expedia at 9am, talked with several people, supervisors, now it is 2pm, the issue is not resolved. Lesson learned: Do not use Expedia again!! Do not use Expedia again!

I called  Expedia customer service line and spoke to Alan on August 10th at 2:52PM EST. Alan was not able to locate my cancelled booking for the Kenya trip. I informed him twice this was a trip to Kenya. I repeated myself the third time this trip was in reference to Kenya and he then finally located the reservation. This display poor customer service and sloppy service from Alan. I asked Alan to clarify if there is a certain time when I need to complete a rebooking and if there is a date I need to complete my travel and in reference to using my flight credit. Alan said I can travel with no travel date restriction and as long as I booked the tickets before April 28, 2017 using the flight credit. This issue was then later escalated to his manager, and Vanessa confirmed I need to being travel before April 28th 2017 and end travel date can be any time after April 28th. Alan gave me incorrect information. I inquired if I can use the flight credit and travel with an airline affiliated with Delta. Alan said no, and that my trip and flight must be with Delta. I then mentioned to Alan that my last call to Expedia on July 2nd, I spoke to an Expedia representative and confirmed I can book tickets and use flight credit and travel with another airline as long as at least one leg in the trip is with Delta. Alan put me on a brief hold to inquire if this is true. Alan then said yes, I must travel with Delta airlines on at least one leg of the trip and I can travel with another airlines affiliated with Delta on the other leg(s) of the trip. Alan initially again relayed to me incorrect information. I then asked Alan which airline(s) are affiliated with Delta. Alan then said for me to call Delta to inquire. I told Alan before I can call Delta, I need him to give me the Delta Flight Ticket # and Alan relayed to me an incorrect Delta flight ticket #, 006781750****. I found out the incorrect flight ticket # was relayed to me and by going online to Expedia�s site and located the correct Delta flight ticket #. 006781060****. I informed Alan that he provided me the incorrect flight ticket # Alan denied giving me the incorrect information. Alan proceeded to yell at me and accused me of calling him a liar, which I never did. Alan made an empty threat to me and said, �This line is recorded and to not put words into his mouth.� I then responded to Alan that he can go back to the recording and the recoding will confirm he relayed to me the incorrect Flight ticket #. Alan continued to yell at me and accused me of being a rude client, which was not the case. This clearly display lack of professionalism from Alan, and at the same time displayed poor customer service, and incorrect information to the client. I also asked Alan to show me in writing the policy and rules on using flight credit since I was not able to get a clear answer from Alan. Alan mentioned nowhere on Expedia site display the policy and rule on using flight credit then later spoke to his manager, Vanessa and she was able to find the policy and rule on using flight credit and emailed me the policy and rule to my Yahoo email account. Alan then suggested I speak to his manager and I agreed. In addition Alan asked for my mobile number in case we get disconnected and I provided the number. Alan also repeated my email address as jane1155*@***.com and did not bother to ask me if that was the correct email address. I had to speak over his voice and let him know the email address he spoke of, is incorrect and the correct email address is jane1155_*@***.com. Alan put me on hold for over 40 minutes and I was finally able to speak to his manager, Vanessa. My initial call with Alan lasted a duration of 1 hour and 15 minutes. Completely unacceptable. While Alan placed me on a 40+ minute hold, I used another phone line and I called Delta. The representative at Delta was not able to assist as it is within Expedia�s jurisdiction to handle the ticketing agreement and that Expedia customer service Center should know that I need to fly with Delta on at least one leg of the trip and I can fly with any other airlines for the rest of the other legs  as long as it is within the ticketing agreement. Alan should have known I can use my flight credit and at fly with Delta airlines on at least one leg of the trip, and fly with any other airline (i.e. affiliated and non-affiliated)  and within ticketing agreement by Expedia. Alan did not fulfill adequate customer service skills, and failed to provide me this basic information. After a long conversation with Alan�s manager, Vanessa was able to send me the policy and rule for using flight credit, and included in the email confirming $300 penalty fee for each ticket upon booking a new flight when time come. This email was received by me and to my Yahoo account on August 10th at 4:41PM EST. I then received another email from Expedia customer service on the same day and at 5:02PM, and the email state there is a $350 penalty fee for each ticket upon booking a new flight when time come. This is another example of conflict with information provided by Expedia customer service. On August 10th, Marilyn from Expedia customer service team emailed to me a case # in reference to my complaint against Alan and Expedia and for me to call Expedia customer service line to remediate. I called Expedia customer service center on August 11th at 8:45AM EST and I spoke to Lin, who then transferred me to Pat, whom then transferred me to a manager in the Corporate Office in Las Vegas. I spoke with DJ and he patiently listened, recorded and documented all the complaints listed above. DJ stated Alan will be pulled aside to correct this behavior, remediate the unprofessional behavior and reprimanded. DJ also confirmed the penalty fee for each ticket is $350, and which I asked him to confirm again. While DJ placed me on hold, I went on Delta�s site and found there is a $250 penalty fee for international flight and $50 penalty fee if the ticket was handled by an external ticketing online agency (i.e. Expedia). Based on that policy, Expedia should only charge $300 for the penalty fee. And if I should choose to allow Delta to handle with rebooking my flight, the $50 external ticketing fee would be waived. All of this was never relayed to me from DJ and other Expedia representatives. DJ initially gave me the incorrect information in regards to the penalty fee. http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/ticket-changes-refunds/ticket-changes.html DJ ultimately confirmed there is a $350 penalty fee per passenger. $250 penalty fee from Delta. $50 penalty fee from an external online ticketing fee, and $50 rebooking fee by Expedia. I then expressed to DJ that I have been placed on hold and spent close to 4 hours on the phone to remediate this incident and DJ offered to waive the $50 rebooking fee by Expedia per passenger. I then expressed to DJ that is not acceptable as I am receiving misinformation and different prices on penalty fee from different representatives and I lost my trust with Expedia on providing me the correct information. DJ then offered to give me an Expedia coupon of $200 and I can use to book a hotel or Expedia vacation package which include hotel and flight. I asked DJ if I can use that toward bookings only and he said no. Not only did I receive verbal abuse from Alan, but I also wasted close to 4 hours of my time and away from work to handle this incident and in addition, I am beginning to feel like I am getting scammed. I then expressed this is unacceptable and asked to speak to his manager. I have been a loyal customer to Expedia for over 10 years. I have given a lot of money and business to Expedia. Based on my communication with Alan and Expedia customer service from August 10th and 11th, and the numerous misinformation received by various representatives and unprofessional behavior, I decided to NOT give further  business to Expedia going forward.  Alan is a poor representation of Expedia. My suggestion to Expedia is to bring back customer service call centers to the United States and hire people with proper pay, which will most likely promote  better customer service skills and attitude with handling clients, especially with long standing clients. Please note, I spent a total 4 hours on the phone speaking to various Expedia customer service representatives regarding this one incident, and that does not include the time taken to document the entire incident from my end (i.e. about 1.5 hours thus far). This incident will be posted on various sites that share reviews and past experiences with Expedia. In addition I will formally log a case with BBB.org regarding the unprofessional and sloppy customer service provided by Expedia�s customer service Center.",cancellation"Refused to refund deposit/payment.

Calls were made to Jackson Lake Lodge and Expedia the same day the flights were cancelled to notify them of this. Earliest flights we could get were three days later to get to Jackson Hole.

I booked the ticket on 2nd of July for a ticket worth $775 flying on 4th of July. Ticket booked payment done and I received an email with all the details. Just 12 hours prior to the flight I received an email from Expedia that your flight is cancelled. I immediately called Expedia which was handled by Rocky I explained him the situation and after putting me on hold for 10 mins he calmly said the airline cancelled your flight and we apologise - I said what do you mean cancelled? I paid and you charged me and flight are booked and he said apologise again and let me book another flight for you (this is a holiday season and finding flights is a nightmare) - Then I asked to transfer to a supervisor and it took them 30 mins on hold till a lady named Daisy answered. She took another 15 mins to figure out what happened and then said since your ticket was not issues and airline fare increased Emirates has cancelled the ticket and its nothing they can do. I was shocked - I booked a ticket with them and paid the full amount and was expecting them to get the ticket issued immediately. This has been my experience of flying in last 30 years that once full payment is done the ticket should be issued and airlines cannot increase the fare. Expedia waits for like 24 hours before issuing a ticket and if during this period the airline fare increases they tickets get cancelled and they refund your money and keep the customers without a booking at the last moment. Their customer team doesn't understand the frustration of having to cancel the flight 12 hours before you are on off for your holiday then she conveniently offered me to book the same flight for $931 (without luggage and $50 charges in case of refund) and said this is the best they can do. Pathetic!!! Please stay away from them and book tickets directly with the airlines as the fare they offered is the same and you don't have the hassle of Expedia. Eventually, I contacted Emirates and got the  same flight ticket for $931 with luggage and free refund option - So Expedia experience cost me $155 extra and $25 phone bill (since I was on phone with them for an hour or so and it was an intl call).

They said to call Expedia and have then process the cancellation as they charged my credit card. Expedia would not cancel my reservation and lied to me about what the hotel said to them. They did not allow me to listen to their conversation with the hotel nor would they recognize that the hotel stated three separate times to me that they have no problem canceling the reservation.

Tried to change a flight through the Expedia service callcenter, paid the change fee plus an airfare difference, however, I still failed twice. One time they claimed the credit card details weren't correct and called me the following day. The second time they claimed everything is ok, but then I arrive on departure date to checkin counter and the airline found only an open type ticket. Calling the hotline from the counter left me waiting 1.5 hours. By then the flight left without me. Expedia was unable to input the flight no. in the airline's booking system. The airline staff expressed surprise given the lack of competency of Expedia callcenter staff. A supervisor booked an alternative route for the going and promised that return flight remained unchanged. When I got the itinerary later it showed an 11 hour stopover whereas a 3 hour stopover was originally booked. Calling the callcenter again to get this amended resulted in them asking me for the change fee plus additional fees for new flights as cost had risen. Expedia staff blamed it on the airline who are charging. Expedia, while the airline may be charging you could be covering that charge on your side, but you decided not to do so.

We called this afternoon to find out if we could cancel a return flight  My husband and I booked flights but needed MY return date cancelled. He specifically repeated that we only want to cancel my flight back. The expedia service agent, Moraldo, confirmed that he is only cancelling the return flight for me -and gave my name & surname. So while still on the phone my husband gets an email - we were credited for a big amount- and my husband asked why we were credited for that much if he only cancelled the return flight. Moraldo then said he made a mistake...  Then proceded to put us through to somebody but got cut off. Never received a returned call. We called expedia again & my husband was on the line for 2hours to try speak to a supervisor  Once we finally got through after being put on hold the supervisor, Conrad, told us that they will need to listen to the recording & get back to us within 2 weeks. We are meant to fly out on the 30th of April which is around the corner but must now sit around and wait to see if they will rebook that flight. I cannot wait that long as I need to be at our destination for work on the 2nd of May. What if there are no flights?  All expedia needed to do was rebook me on that flight (that the agent cancelled) but they cannot do it??  Now we are being held liable for Expedia's mistake. It is rediculous that they treat their customers like this.  I am currently still on hold after the supervisor, Britney put me on hold an hour ago. It is now 10:40 pm here. Our first called made at 2pm All she keeps telling me is that there is NOTHING she can do. She said that we can rebook the flight but WE must pay for it!

After a week of not hearing anything further, I phoned the hotel directly and was informed that they had no such request from Expedia. Luckily, I was still outside the cancellation window and they graciously cancelled it on my behalf. The other issue is that Expedia billed my credit card for over $900.00, leaving me to still deal with that problem. In the meantime, I've registered a dispute with my bank credit card company.

I couldn't get on the flight because my passport expires within six months of travel ( by one day actually)  so I asked Expedia for a refund immediately when I got home from the airport.  They have a 24 hour free cancellation policy but it was slightly over 24 hours.  I have been calling them almost every day now for two weeks asking for the refund.  Every time I call, they have to start the process all over again even though they take notes in their system.  So they have to call the hotel and ask their permission for a refund.  Since the hotel is on the other side of the world and the time is different, they require me to call them in the middle of the night so they can put me on hold to call the hotel for cancellation permission.  Most often, the hotel doesn't answer or the person who can give authorization is not there.  I have also been contacting the hotel separately from expedia and I spoke to the reservations department whom told me that expedia never even paid them for the hotel and so they don't even need permission to get a refund.  So finally after about 11 days of frustration and anger and calling and sitting on hold day after day for 30-50 minutes and waiting for expedia to call me back as they claim they will, I finally get approval for a refund.  Expedia says it will be processed in 24 hours but after 72 hours, I got impatient and contacted Expedia again and they have no record of approving my refund and so the process starts all over again and I'm still on hold while they contact the hotel for permission to cancel.  I am so frustrated.  I will NEVER EVER EVER use expedia again.  EVER.  This has been a nightmare.  It is almost worth giving up the money because of how upset it has made me.  And every time I call, the expedia people say ""Don't worry, we will handle this"" and it's such a joke it makes me even more frustrated.  I did a little research online and apparently, there are people who have waited months for a refund.  I used expedia for all my trips and we travel a lot and never needed to cancel anything but after this trauma, I can never use expedia again.  The risk of going through this just to save a few bucks is not worth it.

Our passport was valid over 1 month past our return date, giving the impression that this was in fact a valid passport, especially after there being no such notations of any kind on Expedia's itinerary to suggest otherwise. Expedia was unaware of this policy and Lufthansa had to explain this over the phone to them, as we were waiting at the ticket counter getting denied boarding. Complete incompetence on Expedia's part. We were not informed of this by either Lufthansa or Expedia, as the tickets said ""CONFIRMED - There is no need to call us to reconfirm this reservation"", and missed the flight due to their negligence to inform us of this.

On vacation, upon flying to Los Angeles for a wedding, while attempting to pick up our Hertz rental car to then travel to Seattle, the agent at the counter informed us that the car would have to be returned to LAX Hertz.

Alexander, the supervisor at Expedia's support desk, at long last worked out a resolution, with a case number, that would include them refunding $700.13 toward the new rental car of $874.97, which we had to pay for ourselves, in addition to the original amount we had to pay for the car in the package. To date, they have only refunded $444.13.  We continue to be told that another supervisor would be calling us back to further resolve the issue, but no one ever has.

I spent a day dealing with incompetent customer service representatives who cannot even transfer calls properly.  They hung up trying to transfer me, then told me I had to contact the airline.

Twice in the past month we have booked rooms and plane tickets with Expedia and the companies do NOT want to honor reservations.  Two weeks ago we had booked a room for one night at a hotel here in Nashville. We had a confirmation number and our credit card was charged. When we went to check in at the hotel we were told they were full and don't recognize Expedia and don't deal with them. If you have a problem with them to contact Expedia. We have since contacted Expedia several times and have not been able after two weeks to talk to a live person. Emails sent seem to go into a black hole. How can Expedia sell and book reservations on their website when the hotel says they don't recognize or honor them.  Current dilemma is reservations at a hotel in Las Vegas. Reservation is confirmed and room is available and reserved. When a call is made to the hotel we're directed to Expedia for any questions. Does Expedia legally represent these establishments or not??????? They are very quick at taking your money and then they're done with you and the providers so you made your arrangements with Expedia deal with them. Someone is not being honest and above board. How can Expedia operate as a legal entity if they only have a website and sell services that no one wants to honor.

Your website says to ""Call or email Expedia""  However, there is NO PHONE NUMBER anywhere I could find on the Expedia website. I wasted 45 minutes going in circles on the website until I got fed up and went to ""www.gethuman.com"" which immediately provided the necessary phone number as well as instructions for navigating your arcane computerized phone answering system. Pretty shoddy in my opinion when you give instructions that are IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW without outside assistance!! Further, while the website makes it sound as if simple changes are easy to accomplish within the first 24 hours after booking, I found the opposite. After wasting more than an hour on the phone with some foreign ""Call Center"" flunky who was barely understandable, the only option presented was to cancel entire reservation then rebook at a significantly higher price - the apparent scam in the first place as that was the very first option ""suggested""  All attempts to leave feedback on Expedia's website ""Leave Feedback"" apparently hosted by third party company called ""OPINION LAB"" the Expedia feedback web link is non-functional and will not allow you to leave feedback.

My girlfriend was in a bad accident and in critical condition at the hospital. We had a trip to Hawaii coming up and I had booked the flight through Expedia. We cancelled the trip two weeks prior to leaving. Expedia would issue only a credit voucher with the airline. Additionally there was going to be a $400 re-booking fee when I went to re-book a flight.  I thought this was really messed up due to the circumstances, but things were already super stressful with my girl being hurt so badly, so I didn't fight with them. I have tendency to get really angry when big corporations screw people over, and I wanted as much energy as possible to totally and unconditionally be there for my girl. I knew we'd used the voucher anyway. What was even worse was my girl had a lot of damage done to her body and was going to be disabled for awhile. The doc said a year of physical therapy would be needed and flying was out of the question. Then my mother got sick and I needed to fly back home so I called Expedia to use my voucher and book the flight. I know this sounds like a sob story, but it's what happened! lol.  The voucher was for $1109. My ticket back east was $500, so I thought great, my voucher will cover it. However, because one of my tickets was in my girlfriends name, I could only use half the credit which was $554 and then half the re-booking fee, which was $200, which left me with $354. I honestly couldn't afford the extra $200. This was a shocker. No one explained this to me, nor did the email they sent me say this. In fact, the email said - ""Dear Matthew, You have a voucher for $1109"". It didn't even mention my girlfriends name. I was really upset about this. I explained the situation with them and they didn't care. They would do nothing. I talked to a manager named Lusha, who barely spoke English and was rude and then I spoke to another manager named Arturo who spoke English but was extremely rude. He told me it was my responsibility to read all of the terms and conditions when I purchased the ticket.  I just couldn't believe that they wouldn't help me. Plus, Expedia is the only company I have used to book travel through for years and I travel a lot for work. I use them to book everything - hotels, vacations, etc. I have been a loyal customer. I was furious that under the circumstances they would not assist. I even gave them the option of just paying for the remainder of my ticket back east - an extra $200 - nope. I asked Arturo to have his manager call me and he told me it would be 7-10 days!! Wow.  This just goes to show that Expedia is just another greedy, evil big corporation, that's so big they don't give a *** about their customers.",others"Reservation cannot be honoured.

I wanted first class plane seats. I know they cost more, but I was ok with that. I booked the package. Within minutes of booking the trip, I realized that they did not give me first class tickets on our flight home. So I called their customer service. The first representative I spoke to couldn't help me. She said she would transfer me to a supervisor, but it would be an hour wait. I said fine I'll wait. An hour and a half later I was still on hold.......... THEY HUNG UP ON ME!! So I called back. I had to wait another 25 minutes before they picked up. Then as soon as someone took my call I asked to speak to a manager, and also said I was on hold for an hour and a half then was hung up on. I was then put on hold to talk to a supervisor again. 53 minutes later the supervisor picked up. She first tried to say I didn't gat charged for first class. I said yes I did. She then asked me to hold. 20 min later she came back on and said I do have first class seats on the way there, just not on the way back. I again told her I should not have to pay for first class on the way home because I didn't get those seats. Then she said if you have first class on one flight you pay for both flights even if that's not what's available. I said that's not right, and half an hour ago you told me I didn't pay for them now your saying I did. The rest of this very long story short, 8 phone calls and 6 and a half hours, and 5 supervisors later I was done being on the phone with them. The next morning I cancelled my trip. A few hours later the trip was still pending on my account, with the exception of half of the money for the airline tickets. So I called again. This time my call was sent to a supervisor after 17 min on hold she answered.  The supervisor assured me that the half of the airline tickets that was already off my account wouldn't go back onto it, and the remaining shouldn't go through. The next day (today) it went through, ALL of it, including the half of the tickets that  already off of my credit account. So I called again. The supervisor I talked to said there's nothing he could do, it went through and will come off in 5 business days. He couldn't answer why I was told that. I asked to speak to his supervisor and he would not let me. He said ""My supervisor will tell you the same thing I am. I said I wanted something to be done, because I had been lied to multiple times. All he said that it was a ""miscommunication"" I said I was going to contact the better business bureau, and hung up.

I was not able to have a competent conversation with anyone about this best price guarantee program when I found one that beat the one we booked. My calls are funneled to the Philippines call center, I try to explain that I am trying to get this best price adjustment or go through the process. They begin switching me over and over eventually hanging up on me. It happened over and over. I think the Guarantee claim is a scam and that is why they switch you around and hang up on you. My advice is research your trip and look at all companies, book the best deal. Not expect this BPG ever to happen for you. And book during the week day not the weekend.",others"A  Providers View. We are a small boutique accommodation provider located in Australia, we have been with Expedia for 10 years. The relationship at times has been a rocky one particularly with regard to their lack of assistance and responses to issues arising. All well and good to issue a case no for an incident but then do nothing. About a week ago after a period absent from the business for holidays we returned to find an email saying that our business had been ""suspended from sale"" no other explanation provided. We contacted our product manager who advised it was over an outstanding invoice from 4 months prior. according to our records the invoice had been paid.  We requested a full reconciliation of the accounts which is only fair and reasonable, they have failed to comply. Repeated emails to Expedia and its staff have failed to evoke a response or any assistance and in fact the product managers supervisor suggested that we just pay the amount claimed and they would re instate us. That to me is tantamount to bribery. (pay the money problem goes away) We have now demanded that they remove us from any online presence and we are signed up to a new OTA. We shall wait and see what happens. Expedia is a large US based company with little customer focus, they are as uncaring with their providers ans they are with their clients. Buyer beware",othersBait and switch. booked a smoking room should have been 109 a night got billed 200 for BS hotel room went to the bbb Expedia to the BBB because I booked through the web site and not there customer reps (wait time on phone 20++ mins)  that they are not responsible IT IS THIER WEB SITE !!!

I have worked the past 6 years in a franchise hotel that is the worlds largest hotel chain. It isn't expedia that is a problem but cheap guests that lie about # of guests @ check in and don't understand reservation policies. If you book Expedia I can guarantee you that we will assign our worst possible rooms (usually pet rooms) and could care a less if you give us a poor review. So stop being cheap and book directly through the hotel. And no we won't match expedias rates. You wouldn't cancel your flight and not expect a penalty, so why should hotels pay for your mistake of booking wrong dates, wrong locations, room type? By the way our hotel receives outstanding scores through tripadvisor and our own brands customer care centre, so believe me we are not an anomaly when it comes to detesting Expedia guests",others"3 strikes and you're out, Expedia. I have never written reviews of products or services, but I feel so strongly against Expedia that I feel I must warn others about this provider. I would not have booked another trip with Expedia after my first bad experience, but sadly, I had booked 3 trips with Expedia around the same time, without knowing what a bad decision that was. It was one horrible experience after another. 1. I had booked a trip to Peru with my family, with plane tickets costing over $4000. I had to cancel the trip a week in advance as I was very ill and in no condition to fly. I called up Expedia and it said that it could not refund me and that I should check with the airline instead. I did so, and the person I spoke to at the airline said that he could refund me all taxes and surcharges paid, amounting to around $800, but that the refund will have to be initiated by Expedia, which made the booking. I called up Expedia to help, and the rep said that she was unable to contact the airline. I gave them the name and contact of the person I spoke to at the airline, but the Expedia rep said they had a different airline contact person. Despite numerous calls, emails and postings on Expedia's website, they did not respond further to me. 2. I booked a stay at a hotel in New York, and somehow Expedia submitted a booking for 2 rooms instead of 1 to the hotel. Upon arrival, I showed the hotel my booking printout, which indicated a booking for 1 room. I asked them to call up Expedia to verify my booking, and Expedia said that the 2nd booking was made by their sister company, Hotel.com. I have never accessed that website and am not sure what occurred at the backend which resulted in 2 bookings made. Expedia was unable to assist in confirming with the hotel that only 1 booking was made. Thankfully, the hotel was kind enough to cancel 1 of the bookings that they had reserved for me and bill me for only 1 room. 3. My third (and final) experience was a booking I made for a trip to Vancouver for a holiday with my family. Much of the fault was with United Airlines, which had multiple flight cancellations and delays during our flights there and back from Washington DC. That said, I had consciously avoided United Airlines, and had booked my trip with Air Canada through Expedia, without realising that Expedia could put you on ANY airline without first alerting you, and they had put me on United Airlines flights. We had 1 connecting flight both ways, and our flights were cancelled/delayed on the way there and back. We had to scramble at the airport to get on new flights, and I had to keep checking the website as I did not receive any alerts through Expedia (despite leaving my mobile number and email), while passengers who had booked directly with the airline received updates and were able to respond more promptly to the flight changes. So that's that. 3 complete disaster bookings with Expedia. Never again. The bookings and payments online may have been smooth and hassle-free, and the prices reasonable, but any subsequent follow-up has been a nightmare. You have been warned.",others"NO RESPONSE AND REFUND FROM EXPEDIA.

Being my first time working with expedia, I NEVER would have imagined what a hassle this company is. My boyfriend and I tried to book a flight, when I went to process my credit card, the website said that there was a problem and my card would not go through, HOWEVER I was immediately charged by one of the airlines and never sent any type of confirmation email for the flight. We spent 2 hours on the phone with customer service, and no one could tell us why we were charged at all for one of the flights as they had no record of it. They told me that they couldnt do anything and I would have to contact my bank and claim fraud although it was CLEARLY not a fraudulent incident. Before getting off the phone with an apparent supervisor at expedia.. she told us that she would help us book our flight over the phone BUT in a matter of 2 hours the flight we wanted had increased by $100 a ticket. She would not honor the price from the SAME flight we tried booking at the very beginning of the phone call. Absolutely horrible experience.  Needless to say we did not book through them after spending 2 hours on the phone and STILL not sorting out why I was charged $400+ with no flight record; we instead book our flight in a matter of 15 minutes through a different company. I will NEVER again try working with this company, and I would definitely not recommend anyone else to go through the hassle. What a poorly run company, with absolutely no integrity.",others"EXPEDIA/MAIN STREET STATION IS A SHADY BUSINESS. EXPEDIA ISN'T DOING BUSINESS ABOVE PAR.   We booked a room for 3 nights in Las Vegas [Main Street Station] after Memorial Day weekend.  A family emergency came up and their cancellation policy was one night [plus fees] for no show/cancel.  We contacted Expedia 2 days before our arrival date.  Since we would be charged the one night out of the 3 reserved, we stated we wanted to cancel the other two nights and only stay for the one we were being charged.  IT'S AGAINST THEIR POLICY AND THE HOTEL'S!  Not only did they charge our credit card IN FULL for all 3 nights a full week before our arrival date [instead of a hold or only one night charge], but they said if we only wanted the one night, they would have to cancel the WHOLE RESERVATION.  Since the hotel was fully booked and our room was no longer ""reserved"", they then ""couldn't"" offer us a room for the one night we were being charged.  THIS IS FRAUD!   We have the right to change our reservation.  It's *** on their part because we'd get the one night we already paid, then they Expedia/MSS could resell the room the other two nights for a premium and it would be a win-win situation.  Instead, they want to be greedy. What sweat is it off their backs who stays in the room especially since the hotel already have maids on the payroll and could charge a higher rate to the next person? Also, it seems MSS hotel management doesn't make the decisions to reimburse your credit card.  It supposedly comes from their ACCOUNTING DEPT. which is supposedly open on Sundays between 9-5 on major holiday weekends.  I was an Acc'g consultant - administrative offices, even in Las Vegas are not open on weekends.  It was a trick to try to keep the full 3 day amount since we were due to arrive on Monday and the office wouldn't be open until Tuesday.  It would be less than a 48 hour notice to change/cancel resulting in them keeping all three night's fees.  The Expedia representative, when I mentioned this fact, just stated that's what he was told by the hotel front desk.  Expedia obviously books rooms for anybody and has ZERO customer service standards. Our credit card company's dispute department stated that everything Expedia/MSS did wasn't above par.  They gave us our full amount back since neither one of them would provide a room for the one night we were being charged and that we were more than 48 hours in cancelling the other two nights.  The CC company also HIGHLY SUGGESTED we change our credit card numbers so this vendor and/or Expedia couldn't keep charging us viciously.  Obviously, there has been issues in the past of them doing that very thing to other people.  Immediately after our emergency, we are getting new cards. When a company charges you fully for a reservation days before arrival, then if you have ANY changes claims that they can't be altered in ANY way without penalties plus not honor the obligation to give you a room you're being charged for from the original reservation, then they are not within the law and need to be avoided at all costs.   It's bad enough Las Vegas has resort fees for the same amenities they had years ago plus the outrageous food costs and show tickets.  Vegas used to be a city of comp's, cheap meals, cheap rooms [the point was to get your money on the table, not the bed].  Now, it's become a major tourist trap with thieves all around.  For Expedia to condone that activity and even feed into it shows a major lack of ethics.",others"Expedia didn't not refund me $200 due to misleading information. I booked a cruise trip through Expedia with two cabins. I was eligible to get on-board credit if I submitted the application form. I called the Expedia to ask how to submit the form, and i was told to fill a online form without notifying me that I need to submit twice for two cabins. So i submitted once. After that, just in case I missed anything, I called to Expedia to confirm if I would get all my on-board credit, and i was told i would get them one i was on the cruise. However, when I was on the ship, I only received the credit for one cabin, not two! and the cruise line asked me to talk to my agent. But the agent blame that it's my fault not submit the application. They rejected my request to refund of my on-board credit. I called again to confirm it, and the agent hang me up!!!",others"Expedia will do everything to not honor their Best Price Guarantee. I booked a package deal with Expedia. I later found that same exact package for less price. As per the Expedia Best Price Guarantee, I filed a claim on their website less than two hours later. As per the instructions, I attached screenshots validating and showing the lower price and details. Once I submitted the claim, I was advised that Expedia would get back to me within 48 hrs.    After several days of not hearing from Expedia, I contacted their  customer service again. who stated they would get back to me within 24 hrs. They finally got back to me after 72 hours. I was advised that they had no record of my claim. I then called customer service and was directed to e-mail screenshots and evidence of the claim I had filed since Expedia had no records. I e-mailed Expedia screenshots, photos, e-mails and other records demonstrating that I filed a claim. Each response from Expedia was the same, that they had no record of receiving a claim and could not proceed without the case I.D.  I tried numerous times, all in vain, to advise Expedia that their own system lost, deleted or misplaced my claim and I had no case I.D.; which was the reason I attached the other information and proof they requested. Each time, Expedia just kept denying my substantial poof because they did not have a record or claim. Expedia did everything possible to deny my claim and evidence without justification. It is also suspect that they will get back to you within 48 hours when they know a customer can only cancel reservations without any fees if it is done within 24 hrs, how convenient. Expedia will not honor their Best Price Guarantee so if you find a lower price elsewhere, book your travel there. I wonder how many other claims have been denied under the guise that they never received a claim. It is also very suspect that the claim was filed and submitted via their own pop up window or tab rather than a claim you actually e-mail in from your own account and could easily prove it was sent to Expedia",othersShow Ticket Review.

I have had several problems with Expedia this year. The first instance when I went to book my trip over seas, I had to call in to use my coupon that they had offered me though my email that same day. The agent that date was more than happy to take my payment, and advised that he would get me over to customer services so I could get my 100.00 discount. Once he just transferred to customer service they then advised me that the agent should have taken the discount there and that once I have my itinerary number I cannot get a discount. Since this is not what the agent advised I still requested for him to follow though with with the agent told me and expected my discount. I was eventually transferred to his supervisor, and then from that person to the supervisors supervisor. I was on the phone with them for over two hours trying to get my discount. The amount of me actually speaking to a person was may 1/8th of the time I was on the phone. I was, in the end able to get $100, place back on my card. I did advised the final supervisor that I spoke with the retrain their agents so that other customers won't have to go through the same frustrations that I did.  After that instance I thought everything was fine and dandy till two months later when I woke up the day my flight was scheduled to go out. I go notification on 3.20.15 that my flight with Lufthansa had been cancelled. I tried calling the airline but they did not open till 8am, it was 630am at that time. So, I decided to call Expedia. My first call though to them not a long hold time, the rep that I got on the line I advised of my problem and he just placed me on hold with no warning, and 10 min later the call was just dropped. I decided to give another call back, got another rep, explained my situation again and was then placed on another hold when went for about an hour an 45 min and that call was dropped. By then it was 8am and I decided to give Lufthansa a call, and after a 45 min hold waiting for one of their reps my call was dropped. Once again I decided to call Expedia back, had to wait about 30 min before I got another rep on the line, explained my situation AGAIN, and advised the man to take my information and to call me back if we get dropped, he advised me that there was flight out later that day but he would have to call customer service to see if he could book the fight and ask if I could hold for him, I did. The hold music for Expedia after an HOUR turned into the same hold music that was with Lufthansa and after about another HOUR I was finally patched though to a rep at Lufthansa as I thought. I had to explain the situation to her, and she was able to book me another flight out with Us airways. Got off the phone with her thought everything was fine, not ten min later I get an automated phone call from that airline saying that flight I had just booked had been canceled and to call a number. I called the number that was given to me and reached a rep from us airways and was able to book yet another flight out but from a completely different airport. I though, once again everything was fine, but when I decided to call the airline back one more time just to double check if everything was okay, as from the advised of my ride to the airport, they told me that Expedia had me double booked once I got to London.... and they told me that only Expedia could solve the issue since they are the ones who created it. On the way to the airport I was on another 50min hold trying to get a rep from Expedia, once I arrived to the airport a rep finally answered and once AGAIN I had to explain my situation and she advised that everything had to be done though Lufthansa, so she had to place me on another hold. Quick thinking on my friends part they though to tell me why not just go to the airline here in the airport and see what they could do. It took a gentleman about 5 min from USAirways to fix my ticket and get my flight to leave from that airport rather than the other one. At that time I was still on with Expedia. The amount of hold time that I was on with Expedia was about 5 HOURS. And it only took the man 5 min to fix my problems. I greatly advise against trying to book with Expedia because they apparently don't keep track if the customers on their file at all. Repeating my self to the 4th person got old really quick.",others"Best Price Guarantee is a Scam.

Our 5th anniversary was this Fall, and I am turning 30 this summer. So my husband and I thought a trip during my Spring Break (I am a teacher) was in order. I began researching in January. I am one of those meticulous, type A people. I like to have as much information as possible, know my options, and make an informed decision. This was not my first rodeo at planning an international trip, either. After much research on many sites and speaking with a travel agent, we decided on a trip on Expedia featured as one of their 24-hour �Unreal Deals.� Casa de Campo in La Romana, Dominican Republic popped up at the top of our �all-inclusive� packages search. As previously mentioned, I had already spoken with a travel agent, with our only major criteria being our budget, an all-inclusive package (hotel, flights, meals and drinks), Caribbean beach, and blue water. We had been saving for this trip for months. I mentioned our interest Casa de Campo to our and travel agent. She looked at the Expedia posting and was working on getting a price match for us. Since she knew our criteria, I can only assume she was working under the impression that the package was all-inclusive as well. As the hours passed that day, I was worried about missing the �unreal deal�, so I went ahead and booked the trip though Expedia myself. Shortly after, my travel agent told me that she would have been able to price match. In the following weeks, I researched things to do in La Romana and the excursions offered nearby. We settled on a monkey encounter, and were very excited about being able to see the countryside and interact with the animals. So I went ahead and booked that as well. Fast forward to our arrival at the hotel around 3:00pm on Sunday, March 26. Imagine our surprise when Yajaira (at the concierge) informed us that we did not, in fact, have an all-inclusive package with meals and drinks. Ok, a speed bump, we thought. Let�s just call Expedia and get this resolved. So�so�so wrong. Keep in mind as the phone calls unfold, it costs $0.20 per minute. We were on hold for about 10 minutes, spoke to an associate and explained the issue, and were put on hold again. About 30 minutes later we spoke to a supervisor and re-explained the issue. Then hold again. And so this went on for HOURS as we went from one representative to the next, moving up the chain of command until we spoke to a corporate manager a few hours later (Let�s call her Daisy). By then, it was too late in the day for her to speak with the reservations department of the hotel. She told us she would see to our issue personally the following day when she went to work. She said her shift started at 12:00 (4:00pm our time), but she would go in a little early and get started on it. Next, we had to cancel our excursion to offset the cost. We were both so disappointed that we wouldn�t get to see the monkeys. This was booked through Expedia as well. Imagine how thrilled I was to get back on the phone with them�ugh. And getting through to whom we needed via Expedia for that was also difficult and included more transfers and holding time. I had received a voucher with a timeline for the cancellation and phone numbers to call for assistance. One phone number was supposed to be an Expedia number. Turns out both numbers led to the same person, and he told me I had to call Expedia. He proceeded to give a different phone number. Surprise, surprise, it did not work. So instead, I emailed the person I had booked it with directly. Fortunately, Joel Ernesto with Blue Travel does his job well and got back to me quickly. He was understanding of the issue and was flexible with us. Another couple of hours and $120 in phone calls by the time we were done. By then it was 8:00pm. We were exhausted, downtrodden, and starving. All we had done since arriving was sit on the phone, unpack in our room, and worry. Our entire first half day wasted. I was beside myself, feeling panicked and ever so agitated. I felt sick at the thought of the time and effort I had put into planning this and the extra money we may need to spend. We were finally able to go to dinner around 9:00pm. We looked forward to hearing from Daisy the next day in hopes of getting the issue resolved. In the meantime, we paid for our food and drinks out of pocket. By 5:30 Monday evening we had not heard from Daisy so we called Expedia and tried to be transferred to her directly. But we had to work up the chain of command yet again. Holding, being transferred, and repeating ourselves over and over again. Again, we had paid out of pocket for food and had only eaten once that day. By 7:30pm, we finally had her on the phone. We were standing at the hotel concierge in case she wanted to speak with a Casa De Campo employee. Jose E. took the call and away he went trying to resolve the problem. When he returned, he explained what could be done on the hotel�s end and offered us a few options. Daisy said they had �investigated� the site to see what we saw at the time of booking. She said if we had scrolled down and clicked on this and that, here and there, we would have seen that the meals and drinks were supposedly a separate package and additional charge ($1,200 additional to be exact�oh, and that was at a discount). However, I still do not believe that this was the case. Remember when I said I am type A? My husband says, �borderline OCD is more like it!� If what �the investigators� say is true, then the site is extremely misleading. Daisy said she was not authorized to give us that amount of money. So I asked her if we could get creative and think outside the box to come up with a way to help offset the cost of getting meals and drinks included for the next 3 days. Maybe a credit? Charge just 2 meals with drinks per day to the room and be reimbursed? Pay for our excursion so we could still go? Reimburse part of the trip? Nope! Nada. Nothing could be done, so she said. What a load of bull. She said that she wasn�t authorized to give us the money. My husband asked if we could speak to someone who was authorized. She said that we would just get the same response. Are you kidding me? Really? Expedia can�t afford to reimburse us a few hundred dollars? Un-be-liev-a-ble! Somehow I think they could have made it happen. Like we don�t know the customer service staff is trained to use tactics like making us hold forever on the phone, apologizing, and making sympathetic remarks so we will drop the issue? Cancelling the rest of the trip would have cost us more than staying there, so the trip insurance Expedia offers and that I purchased is a joke. So that was that, we had to stay. And if we wanted to eat, we just had to pay. But I will say that despite all of that, the hotel and property is absolutely breathtakingly spectacular and the staff was very sympathetic to our issue. Remember Yajaira from the concierge? She sent us a bottle of wine after witnessing the first couple of hours of our phone call at check-in. And remember Jose E. who took the call on Monday? As we were in between speaking with and holding for the corporate manager on Monday, I noticed that he was typing and clicking away at the computer and did not leave our side. Turns out, he found us a better room that was available and arranged for us to upgrade, compliments of the hotel. He sent a staff member with us who waited for us while we pack our things and then took us to our new room. If it wasn�t for the kindness of those 2 lovely people and the accommodating nature of the entire staff, I�m not sure how the trip would have turned out. So a huge thank you to all of them, but especially to Yajaira and Jose E. We enthusiastically recommend this property to everyone! In addition to the hotel rooms, there are villas and other room options. And the food? To die for. So, to our fellow travelers--friends, family, acquaintances, and strangers alike, we warn you about using Expedia to book your trips. We hope that no one, ever, has to experience what we did. And if you do choose to use them, call before you book to clarify that you are purchasing exactly what you think you are.

When you're supposed to be on Norwegian cruise line through South America, but instead you're back home in Canada with your children all because Norwegian cares to educate the cruise ship centres about not bringing a Samsung 7 aboard instead of educating their sales centres about proper documentation required to sail through South America. After being told we cannot board because of insufficient documentation, They left us stranded for 7 hours without any assistance, nobody came to our aid, when we were told we couldn't board. They told us someone would help us with computer access or phones to find other means of hotel or accommodation until we resolved the issue. But they never came. No free wifi. We had to use our own. And now our phone bills will be hundreds of dollars. They avoided us until the entire centre cleared out. They didn't bring us water, they just said sit here and someone will come help you. My 6 and 8 year old sat on a chair and waited and waited to hear anything at all. Nobody cared to offer them a drink or maybe some food? No. Nothing. No one came to offer us any help. They told us to find our own way to Uruguay and that the Brazilian embassy could issue a visa to us in 24 hours which was a lie. We tried, we tried a water bus, a bus station, all sold out. We were told it's a week to get an appointment and 3-4 days to receive the Visa. They said anything they could go just get rid of us. We waited 7 hours for our luggage, but Norwegian sailed away with our luggage. We were left there with nowhere to go, no clothing, and Norwegian cruise line offered us not one word of consolation. The agency I booked our cruise though, Expedia cruise ship centres has told me that Norwegian has not educated them on this matter and they weren't made aware by Norwegian. So who is responsible for our trauma, our stress, our tears? Who will make this up to our children who had one outfit, one underwear, and had to return to canada a week too soon without their winter clothing? Who is accountable? Not to mention Expedia for Td sent me a confirmation email that our flights had been switched to a sooner date out of Argentina since we couldn't get to Brazil, however upon arrival at airport Expedia had failed to issue our tickets and couldn't let us board. So we had to, out of our own pocket pay $10,400 for a one way ticket home and we ran through the airport seconds before they closed the gate. Had we not had the available funds we would still be in Argentina, stranded. To this date, I still don't have our luggage. The nightmare Norwegian started, spiralled and continued causing more and more of a trauma for us, for days on end. Tell me Norwegian & Expedia , who is responsible for this. Family and friends feel free to share. We need to create awareness. How are we to know if our agency tells us we don't require any other documentation except our passport? Norwegian told me the previous week 80 Canadian/American people were denied boarding, and our week around 30 Canadian/Americans. They must be proud. And yet week after week this happens with the Brazilian visa and they create ZERO awareness. And ZERO solutions from Norwegian. I sure am happy for our luggage however, sailing the world without us. I'm sure the luggage will have lots of amazing memories to tell our children, those of which we were robbed.",othersDenied coverage to US service member serving in combat zone.

Tried explaining that I was no longer stationed in Djibouti and it would cost me twice the amount to return there ( which I have no desire to see again) on top of price difference for new ticket. Expedia said to file through AON since I bought the insurance. Claim denied as I didn't qualify for medical reason. Apparently serving in a combat zone to protect American interests (that would include AON and EXPEDIA ) didn't count. What a disgrace.

I Bought the full travel protection for any changes. Airline said I had to call Expedia directly to change. I spent over 2 hrs and a half over the phone with Expedia trying to resolve the issue. They had me on hold for that long back fourth saying they needed to see all identification send via email which I sent out in photographs form 10 times but they claim they did not receive it. They sent an email to me I replied directly to it, created new email, also sent it via friend's email. I did everything in order to get the email through but they said they didn't get it! I was extremely angry. How could that have happen. When i made sure there was no server internet issue. Worst of all at he last min before my flight was already going to board, they said unfortunately they have to do it manually and call the airline.I could of done that myself with the airline because I'm there. Yet again had me wait until I'm afraid I'm going to miss my flight. I told them that and they immediately said I had to pay $125 fee right away to do this so I can go on this trip when before they said no fee was going to apply. Last min I said ok but I will need to refund, Expedia said yes, on hold came back and said they just charge me 193 with the airfare change! I was shocked!

They refused to see my proof that I called to ask questions and claim I did not. am very angry at their operation and ruining my vacation. I will never use them again. They need English speaking people who actually knows how to provide correct info to customers and the last min fee charge was unacceptable because I could have easily canceled my trip hours before instead of waiting using the travel protection I bought instead of almost loosing everything and paying the fee for their mistake.

They sold me another ticket for a few hours earlier in the evening, telling me my trip insurance would cover the cost of the first one because of the health emergency. Big surprise, it did not.

My family was effectively left stranded by Green Motion, for no fault of our own. We booked online with them via Expedia and arrived at Edinburgh Airport after a long flight.

A dead-behind-the-eyes jobsworth demanded my husband's NI number, which he could not remember and as it was a Sunday, he couldn't access it via his employers. Bear in mind we had not been asked to provide this and it was not required on our booking documents. They refused to give us the car, even though this left us  virtually stranded. While we were fruitlessly arguing with the staff - who were like robots - other customers were hanging around waiting for cars that weren't ready - and the staff were also very rude with anyone who complained. In the end, we gave up, got the bus back to the terminal, walked round to EuroCar and got a car without any fuss or bother.

After going through an extensive interview process with a reputable manufacturing business, I was to travel 1200 miles to sit down with the upper management, and discuss all of the details of the job, and when I would start. My wife is sick with cancer, and hasn't been able to work for the last several years. Her health has really been declining more rapidly over the last several months and this was going to be an opportunity for her to  relocate to an area of the country where she was wanting to spend the remainder of her life. I booked the flight, motel, and car rental through Expedia, and had the confirmation through them that everything was booked. I arrived at the airport to depart for the flight to my destination, only to find out that the flight had been cancelled when I walked up to the ticket counter. I couldn't get the refund for the ticket right away, and wasn't able to book a flight with another airline to that destination to get to the appointment on time. I directly contacted the mfg company to let them know that I wouldn't be able to get to the scheduled appointment. They rescheduled for the following week, and I used up the last of my vacation time through my current employer to make the trip. This time the flight went well, however when I went to the rental car pickup at the airport to pick up my car to drive to the mfg company, the rental car company refused for me to rent the car. Once again, I had to contact the mfg company and explain that I would be arriving late since I had to talk to another car rental agency to rent a car. I arrived 1 hour behind schedule, and the Management team that I met with didn't seem to enthused that I was repeatedly not able to make appointments. They didn't continue to discuss employment, and told me they would let me know if and when another opportunity becomes available. I am out a lot of money over this horrible experience, and a very good paying job. My wife will probably never get the chance to live out the remainder of her life in the beautiful beach area that she has been talking so persistently lately. I have complained to Expedia about my horrifying experience with them, but they won't respond to my complaint. I didn't realize that they were such a horrible company, but one things for sure.

That's usually due to not wanting to put what seems to be a lot of time and effort into resolving the issues for a certain small amount of money. However, my recent experience with Expedia has opened my eyes. I had made a booking online for what I thought was for 1 night on a specific day, literally 1/2 an hour before I arrived at the hotel. When I arrived, the front desk informed me that my booking was for 3 nights and different dates. I cannot prove where this mistake was made. However, the hotel stated that they could not change or modify that booking. I therefore had to pay $160+ on my credit card so I had a room for that night. It was a long weekend and they said I had to contact Expedia. I tried the following day while I was traveling. However, to be honest there was a language barrier. The person had a very heavy accent and I could not understand them as they also spoke in Broken English. I own a small business and speak with many people, including bookings, and speak with a lot of ""out sourced"" call centers. But this issue was the worst I have encountered. I therefore called back the 2nd day of the 3 days of the incorrect booking. According to their policy, the fact that I cancelled before 5 p.m. on the second day, I expected to be reimbursed for the last 2 nights. I could see them charging me for the 1st night and for any fees and taxes, and even I was willing, to compromise. They said they would have to contact the hotel manager. A week went by. I contacted them twice on a certain day. They put me on hold again for 20min to 1/2hr. They kept saying I'll have to contact a supervisor. Then contact the hotel again. In the mean time I contacted the hotel. The manager spoke with me for a while expressing his views on Expedia. He at least gave me 2 free night stays. However no reimbursed funds and when am I ever going to stay at that specific hotel again??? At least he did something. The 3rd call to Expedia was the same. They kept saying they abide by the hotels policies. The facts are....It was Expedia who the booking was through, Expedia who charged my credit card $431.00+(not including the $160+ I paid for the correct night), and they who restricted the hotel/vendor so they couldn't change or modify the booking, although I was there in person at the hotel. I felt that by minimum the last night would be reimbursed. They did nothing. Absolved themselves of any liability. Let me give you this warning. If you book with Expedia, and your booking is incorrect or there's an issue with it....good luck getting reimbursed or having the ability to change or modify it. They will take your money and run. I will never use them again!!!",others"Review in Travel Agencies category from Elfers, Florida. I have been dealing with the Best Price Guarantee for 2 months now.

When my son and his wife arrived for their flight to Punta Cana, Delta did not have a finalized ticket. Expedia had failed to send the transaction all the way through to complete booking. We were not aware because Expedia was sending email that said all was confirmed. My son was not allowed to take the flight that day because Expedia could not resolve the issue while before the flight departed.  While they did ultimately resolve this by putting them on a flight the next day and providing a hotel for the night, they did nothing to help diminish the disappointment they caused.

What happened to you Expedia?? Did you at least take some time to gaze at the scenery on the way down after you took a swan dive off the face of a cliff? Actually, you didn't even swan dive, you just haphazardly jumped. This company's ""customer service"" is a perfect example of what happens when you screw all of your American employees over and shut down all the American call centers to outsource your customer service. Once upon a time, in about 2004-2005 people would actually call Expedia and be excited to reach an English speaking American to actually help them. But then came new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and the dollar signs in his eyes. Then the company actually made their American employees in Tacoma, Washington fly to the Philippines to train the people that were about to take their jobs. Expedia is greedy. Dara Khosrowshahi doesn't care about anything other than lining his pockets with even more money or buying new gold rakes to continue raking the cash in with. It's pathetic. customer service with Expedia is non-existant. All you get is robotic sounding, rude, heartless pawns who's last concern in the world is helping you save money, even after you've already spent hundreds or thousands with hem.

She stated if I wanted another room it would have to be a single bed because they didn't have any other rooms available and that they would have to charge me another 60.00 dollars. I told her I did not think that was right since I had already paid for the room again she said I had to take it up with expedia. I stated that I was going online to complain and she got very loud and said how can you complain against us when it was expedia's fault. I offered to show her the reservation confirmation number and she stated that doesn't mean anything to her and she didn't want to even look at it.

I am so upset right now!! I called to book a flight using my credit voucher for $746.40. This credit was for myself and for my husband, Pamela J. Davidson and Thomas E. Wilson.  First of all, this credit has already been reduced by another fee taken out from the beginning. We paid more than this for these tickets to San Francisco. So, a fee has already been taken from us.

I had to leave early unexpectedly after my first night stay.  When I went to the front desk, I was told by the clerk that she wasn't able to credit the 2 nights, that the Manager would have to do this and that she would be in either later that day or the next.  I was given a copy of my reservation.  I had the clerk write on it what I originally paid and what I would be given a credit for and had her sign her name.

I was in Buenos Aires, Argentina 3/2/16 through 3/8/16 and booked a round trip transfer from EZE airport to downtown hotels with Gray Line Tours of Argentina, through Expedia's website. Count #1: False Advertising - To begin with Expedia advertised as follows: ""Private Towncar: Ezeiza Airport (EZE): Roundtrip for Hotels."" Well on the day of my arrival, there was no Town Car as was advertised. Instead there was a Fiat econo-box that I could barely fit into given my height (hence the rationale for the Town Car). Count #2: Breach of Contract/Failure to Perform - Now, the major headache I experienced was on the return leg back to the airport. Several attempts to contact Gray Line Tours of Argentina to confirm the transfer back to the airport proved unsuccessful, both via e-mail and telephonically, via the hotel's concierge. I even sent several e-mails to an Ezequiel Perez (e.perez@graylineargentina.com), the person with whom I confirmed the EZE pickup with originally, as well as to reconfirm@graylineargentina.com but to no avail. However, in spite of these failed attempts, on a whim I waited for someone from Gray Line Tours to pickup me up nonetheless at the time, 5:00 p.m., that I specified. I then had to hail a cab at the last minute, lest I missed my flight back to Washington, DC.  And attempts to collect the money, $250.00, I tendered to Expedia.com, the ring leaders in this mess, has been fraught with utter frustration. When I contacted Expedia, the rep. stated that she couldn't get ahold of anyone at Gray Line, for it was too early in the morning according to U.S. Mountain Standard Time. Now this is utter nonsense, for on the voucher, Gray Line stated their business hours as 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, daily local time. When I was talking to the Expedia rep. about a refund, it was 10:57 AM, Buenos Aires time. The real disappoint here is really with Expeida.com, for they should do a better job of vetting these third-party providers. I have done exactly $17,498.08 worth of travel business through Expedia.com and will not do another penny with them after this experience, not to mention Gray Line Tours.

I thought I was placing a reservation directly with the hotel. They scammed the website which was actually Expedia. When I checked in there was someone in front of me checking in. I noticed that they were paying 86 dollars a night. When it was my turn to check in I asked the desk clerk if I could get that rate and she said yes I could but that I was booked with Expedia and Expedia pays the hotel and I would forfeit what I had paid to Expedia. Expedia hijacked the Hampton Inns website. They even printed my reservations on blue paper that said reservation counter just like Hampton Inns. $114.00 a night compared to $86.00 is a rip off. I would never use Expedia for anything,even though I never knew I was using them in the first place. The bottom line is stay away from EXPEDIA AND RESERVATION COUNTER. SCAMMERS!",price change"booking Review from Austin, Texas. I saw a price on the web site, but It won't let me pay, I called customer service, they said they will be able to buy it with that price.

I had to called back, after 10min, the price had changed 10 dlls more but the customer service said there were no booking registered on my account, and that there was no way to contact the same person to follow up. Because the use one of those ""outsourcing"" services where nobody is in the same place. I HAD TO SPEND ANOTHER 20 min rebuying the ticket, they said the price had increase $45 dlls because the airline already change the prices EVEN THAT I STILL COULD SEE IT ON THE PRICE I FOUND On the first place EVEN AFTER REFRESHING THE WEBSITE MANY TIMES.

I have used Expedia a few times and find it only useful with extremely expensive high-end hotels.  In all other cases, the price I would have paid booking directly with the travel and lodging provider(s) was lower.  Each time I brought this up with Expedia, they found some fine print to support not honoring their ""best price guarantee.""  Also, after taking time out of my rather tight schedule to write a review on a truly horrible hotel (and making triple sure it met all guidelines,) Expedia refused to publish it.  After inquiring, I was informed that the hotel chain they ""partner"" with paid them to keep bad reviews off their website.

Worst vacation ever.  Have always done my own reservation.  This time there was a snag and the Expedia rep made it for us, guaranteeing us that my husband was included in package.  Had confirmation # and email as proof.  Only problem is that they rep did NOT include my husband, and the hotel would NOT honor the confirm # or the email.  I even questioned them at the time of the reservation what to do if this happened.  ""Oh just call us"".  Yeah right.  Borrowing a phone with international service.  Waited on hold 1 hr one day.  Was assured a supervisor would fix issues and get back to me.  2 days later hotel issue is still not resolved, no supervisor, and hotel wants to charge another $1000.   Waited another hr on hold.  After 30 more min get transferred to Alejandro who can't find the prior call documentation and asks me to send him the confirmation email. I do, and then he hangs up on me. Stuck in Mexico, no one will help, had to pay another $1000.",price change"I did not realize hotel price was raised while completing deal because air & hotel are combined. While booking a trip for several days, hotel price was $189. Then I decided to  add and combine with airfare also to get a bundle rate, and they raised the hotel by $95.00 without my knowing.  They show a lump sum with no breakdown between air and hotel. So it is confusing, you do not know how much they are charging for either.   I did not catch it until later, when my credit card split payment between hotel and airline. I understand rates could change any time but final payment page should show breakdown costs  so you would be able to notice it.",price change"Hotels.com SUCKS. hotels.com, an Expedia brand, cannot seems to avoid sleazy tactics. The latest is retaining a deposit for a cancellation despite the fact that the hotel indicated they would accept the cancellation with penalty based on the circumstances. hotels.com uses foreign-based CSRs who are clueless and powerless. Finally, read the fine print in their Lowest Price Guarantee very carefully...that one is full of loopholes so when you get screwed their crack CSRs (if you can understand him or her) will explain that this particular instance doesn't qualify.

I booked this room last week through Expedia because in the past I trusted Expedia for the best prices.  Through some accounting error the Sheraton where I stayed at sent me a bill for the room.  As it turned out, going right through them was $35.00 cheaper than the Expedia saver rate.  What I hate is their claim to be offering the best available room rates and it turns out to be not even close to true.  Even the Sheraton didn't understand it.   They offer the travel sites a discount for rooms that they won�t offer on their website.   I will never use Expedia again.  $35 isn�t a lot of money but I used them for the past 10 years and now wonder how much they burned me for in the past.",price changeExpedia- a bait and switch travel agency in my opinion. I booked a London non-refundable hotel at $191 a night.  When I saw the bill after I paid the average price per room $228.62.  I went back to the website and put the same dates in for the same hotel and the room was now priced at $205 a night.  My $228.62  non-refundable hotel room was more expensive than the refundable hotel room Expedia had advertised.   I called Expedia. After 15 minutes I finally spoke to a supervisor who said the hotel changed the price while I was booking it. He would not provide any Expedia mailing address.  I would avoid Expedia as they appear to be dishonest travel brokers.,price change"False advertising - they jac up the price while you're booking. I was shopping for a flight from YYC to LGA and was initially happy to find several options for $450 (which is the regular fare and it is reasonable). However, when I tried to book it an error message informed me that the price has changed (blaming the airline for changing it while I was booking). The updated price was a hefty $1300! I repeatedly tried to start from scratch, tried different combinations, flights, airlines, etc. Every time the price would shoot up by more than double. This is looking more and more like false advertising. I understand that the airline changes prices on a whim, but Expedia is in no hurry to update their posted prices - they took several hours to do so. In the meantime, you think you will get the posted price, maybe make some plans, maybe book a hotel.. and then, surprise, they ask for more, always more, it's never less. I would not recommend booking anything on expedia. There are other websites out there, and if you really see a good deal, maybe look it up on the airline's own website.",price change"Expedia pending charges on my credit card for booking that did not go through.

I wanted to book a flight to home but the online system kept giving an error. So I called the Expedia customer service to book it on phone. She told me that the flights were about 200$ more expensive than what was showing online. So, it was showing 1167 but was actually 1350, according to her. 'The fares have just gone up as we are talking' And oh look, here is a 'vacation package' available at 1360, if you buy a hotel night alongwith it. Since I was going to stay with family, I politely refused say I didn't need a hotel at all, but she was insistent-'it doesn't cost much more than your flight only' I bought the 'vacation package.' When the itinerary came, the fun thing to note was: Flight $1167, Hotel for one night $195. Curiously, I checked and found no such 'vacation package' Both the flight and hotel were selling separately at those prices!!! The flights were still selling for 1167 (throughout the evening!!!!), I checked everywhere and found the same rate. And oh, the nerve of that girl to lie blatantly to my face.What a shame! Finally, I had to call the *** company to cancel all of my 'vacation package'. They are pathetic when it comes to cancellation so you have to wait and wait and wait on phone. the whole process cost me FIVE HOURS!!!!  I then went to the airline itself and bought the ticket for 1167!! without a hotel. Lodged a complaint with expedia, though I doubt they could care less. Hated expedia. Never going to trust them again. Lesson for the expedia management: If a customer trusts you enough to call you to book a flight, don't LIE TO THEM!!!!! people aren't fools. You are.

Booked a room for two adults and 4 children for one night at Key Lime Cove in Gurnee, IL only to find out at check in that the room that sleeps 6 was booked for only 2 adults.  Key Lime Cove charged me an extra $130.00 on top of the $185.00 room charge through Expedia for one night for the children to use the water park. Bottom line don't book rooms for Key Lime Cove through Expedia. The Key Lime Cove reservation clerk told me this happens a lot with Expedia.

For me and my wife, that comes to $1636.  The hotel quoted me a rate of $110.  If you do the math, you'll see that they charged me about $200 more.  When I called customer service numerous times, they never picked up.  However when you call to actually book a reservation, they pick up within 30 seconds.   I did this as a way to get to customer service.  But the reservation agent and his supervisor, just put me through to customer service again, and so I would have had to wait again.

We complained to the hotel manager, Angel, who told us we had to go through Expedia for our refund of $2,187.75 USD. No credit has been made by Expedia. I've filed a complaint with my credit card company. Another problem is overcharging on conversion rates. I use an international credit card.

I bought a plane ticket from Latam Airlines through Expedia. I needed to make a change to the reservation. I found on Expedia's website that the policy of the airline was to charge a US$300 fee for changes to the reservation, plus the price difference between the current price of the ticket and the price of the original ticket. The website also instructed me to find an alternative flight before calling to make the change. I found through Expedia one flight with a price difference of only US$268, but when I called to modify the reservation, the price quoted by the customer representative for such flight was US$200 higher. Instead of paying a difference of U$268, I would have to pay a difference of more than US$400. When I mentioned that this was not the quoted price on their website, the representative told me that the policy of the airline was to price the flights differently for people making changes to existing reservations and that this was not Expedia's decision/responsability. I think this is incorrect since not only they charge a fee (US$300) for changing the reservation but also a higher price than the one available to anyone else, and Expedia should have made the appropriate disclaimer about it so that whoever buys a ticket with through Expedia can be aware of this additional costs. There was no effort by the representative to find a solution.",price change"                I booked a trip on Expedia, a few hours later Expedia showed the exact same trip $200 lower.",price change"Bad pricing Riverdale Utah.

No! Taxes were included in my charge, when i went back to show them my e mail, they gave me the $20 back, but with no discount. She says that was with the discount. No it wasn't, on top of that they could not give me a recipient because they said expedia doesn't show the prices on their end.

True enough about the reviews, it's only a disappointment to all your customers, and what make it more worse that you guys are not even doing anything about it! You make your customers wait and wait for no reasons! So here's my complaint. I called the hotline and make a booking for flight and hotel to Athens. Firstly, your customer service rushed through the whole process of your reservation, and it's not delightful enough in his services just by his tone of voice. He mentioned the amount is $2407.67 but in the end amount deducted is $2475.08! What is wrong with you people? Why are u guys telling your customers a different amount and charged a different amount? Why are you guys not fully equipped to provide your customers the correct information? What do u mean by extra charges? Excuse me, I'm calling in the hotline, so why is so difficult to let me know ?! What kind of customer service is this?! I'm totally frustrated and not happy that I'm being charged extra for the amount which is not being told !!!!! People do their research before making a booking not get cheated with your unprofessional service! The least u could do is to inform but u did not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What a worse ! Secondly is the booking I made personally for the hotel which is $527.54 but it was charged as $542.31!!! Your website doesn't even indicate any ***. I clearly remembered that it states there includes all charges are inclusive! This is going to be the last time that I'm going to book through Expedia!

Our booked hotel was sold out (and most hotels) and showed our reservation as cancelled. Expedia showed our reservation as active and attempted to relocate us. The first relocation specialist put me on and off hold for 1 1/2 hours but found a room for $600/nt so he said he was going to keep looking for a less expensive hotel (now 7:30pm). The call was disconnected. The second call to a relocation specialist ended in finding a room but was not able to accommodate four people and was disconnected after being on the phone/on hold for 1 1/2 hours (now 9pm). The third call to a relocation specialist ends in there not being a room to accommodate us, at which point I burst into tears. Thank God for a mellow baby and the front desk of the sold out hotel for letting us use their phone, sit in their lobby, find us a room at the Inn at Laurel Point and finish waiting on hold for Expedia to come back on the line in an effort to resolve the problem. So when we got home we called expedia to ask for the difference in price since we had to book a higher rate due to emergency (on our own, expedia left us homeless on the victoria streets and had a painful indifference about it), we again had to wait an hour online, only to have a ""manager"" say she couldnt do anything for us, put us on hold for an hour before we got hung up on. After another hour on hold we got connected to a ""person in corporate"" who basically had an ""i dont care"" tone and refused to do anything for us other than a $50 credit. She had no interest in helping us, nor did anyone there, they basically put you on hold so long and hope you go away.

I will never use the Hilton or Expedia again!",price change"False Advertise and Hijack you at the Hotel Counter - Class Action Suit. During the Last 6 weeks I have used Expedia to reserve a room at two different hotels twice.  On both occasions the website advertised rooms at a fairly low price $87 - $116.   The first time, I got to my hotel, it was not until that I was standing at the counter that I was informed that my reservation was for 6 months later (November 2016) and BTW it was a non-refundable room.  So I had to spend 2 hours at the counter trying to get them to undo their ""MISTAKE"".  Their computer reset my reservation dates for six months later.  I informed them that this was not my mistake and that they needed to fix it.  So as I am trying to resolve this they (Expedia) offer me the room at a rate that is about a 75% higher.   I believe that they are doing this on purpose.  Because when your tired and standing at the hotel counter who wants to deal with this.   So most people just pay.  But that's not me.  I finally was able to get them to remove the non-refundable charges for the room thanks to the help of a kind desk clerk.  I still had to pay 10% more for the room.  The second time this happened I caught the mistake right away.  When you click on the button to move forward with the reservation it changes the dates for six months later.  So this time the reservation was for December 2016.  So once again I had to go through a whole process of getting them to remove the ""non-refundable"" charges.  Now consider this; when I talked to the Expedia people they were not even surprised that this had happened either time.  So I believe that they know exactly what is happening.  Because they went through the process like they had done it before.  So here is the scam: They get you to make a reservation and then change the dates through a ""computer glitch"" which they take no responsibility for.  When I asked the Expedia person for a receipt stating that I would not be charged they said that they are not able to provide this.  I believe that this is their way of covering up and preventing the existence of their business practices because there is no paper trail.   Expedia you are setting yourself up for a class action lawsuit and I am also going to be complaining to my state solicitors office and letting them know how you are doing business.  Regardless if it is a scam or just bad business, it is wrong.",price change"With a pre-arranged, one day rental, Price doubled!.

Next day I find out ALL of the cards were charged and they didn't catch it (in fact one of my cards was shut down for fraud activity and I had to call them)--now I either cant get anyone that I understand, or cant get anyone that listens and understands what I need done.

Unfortunately, due to an illness in my family, I had to change the flight to leave a week earlier.  I did not need to change the return flight.  I went onto Expedia's website and the flight leaving on March 16 and returning on April 5, the flight cost $392.00 so I figured if I changed it, I would only need to pay the difference after adding the $125.00, which to me would have been an additional $62.00.  When I contacted Expedia to change it, they insisted the flight cost was $431.00 (even though I was looking at their website showing the price as $392.00), I would lose the additional $24 plus I had to pay the additional change fee of $125.

Do not book with Expedia/Trivago!!!!!!(same company). I am still owed a refund from August because of a fault on their part. This is my experience with them: I searched for accommodation for 7th-8th August 2015 on Trivago, checking several times that I had searched the correct dates. Chose to book Eden house in Key West.  After having driven the 4 hour drive to key west from Miami we went to check in to the hotel. We then were told that we were booked in for the 28th August 2015!  The lady who worked at the hotel said that this has happened before and that if the hotel is not available sites such as trivago change the date to one that is available.  Eden house were fully booked and so we were unable to stay at the hotel. The lady checked for other hotels for us but there were none available under 350 dollars as it was a special festival weekend and the ones that were available were at the other side of the island.  Several weeks later I received an email from Expedia advising me that they had contacted the hotel and that I needed to call them so that they could process the refund. I explained that it would cost me a fortune and that I would like to be put through to a manager. Instead of dealing with one person, I had emails coming through from several different people one explaining that they needed to contact the hotel before being able to promise a refund. I was so frustrated because they had already contacted the hotel!!!!! They had clearly not looked at the string of emails prior to this one. It was clear that no one understood what I was saying and that they were clearly filling in a template of standard phrases.  I felt hopeless and worried that if I did ring this number it would not only cost me a fortune but I would be put through to someone who would tell me something different and that it would never get sorted. I contacted the hotel, put me on hold several times and eventually he managed to arrange a refund.  I then asked if there was anyone I could contact to complain as I felt I deserved compensation for the cost of my phone calls and for the hassle it had caused me. it's been two and a half weeks and the refund still has not come into my account!

We called Expedia to rectify this, change our room or just cancel so we could get a room we desired.  After talking to 10 people we got nowhere.

My husband tried phone Expedia to find out what we can do, after many attempts he finally got a female telling him she could not access our records to phone back, so my husband did the very next day and was told the same thing. At this point I was very upset knowing our holiday was not going to happen. My husband phoned Expedia again to see if we could get some sort of refund or reimbursement and my husband was basically called a liar by the gentleman over the phone and after my husband repeating our story many times and asking for help was told, Expedia would not help him because they did not believe him and kept repeating to my husband 'sorry Sir I do not believe you' after many attempts to explain it my husband ended up hanging up in frustration.

However, when we got to the hotel, we found things drastically different.  Click here to pay and complete your transaction through Expedia.com"" or something like it. The clerk quoted us a price to book an identical room to the one on the Expedia page (for slightly LESS than the amount Expedia would have charged). The clerk had a great deal of difficulty establishing the lack of a booking in the first place and then using the exact same information to check us in immediately thereafter, and we were privy to two episodes of sexual harassment by one potential guest against female guests while we waited.  From all I've read in the last hour and a half, this situation is standard fare for Expedia users, and my review is only one of many. I will never use Expedia and will actively discourage friends and strangers from doing so.

Then I called the hotel myself and asked for a refund. The hotel said Expedia has to confirm.

This is a copy of a letter I wrote to Expedia's CEO with no response  We received an email confirmation for air fare and 3 rooms. When we arrived at our hotel at 4:00 pm, we were told that only one room was reserved; 2 were cancelled by Expedia. We were also told, by the hotel, that we would have to contact Expedia and once Expedia confirmed our reservation for 3 rooms, they were prepared to honor the booking. So all that Expedia, who already had collected all of our money, had to do was communicate to The Condado Plaza Hilton that our booking was genuine. Numerous attempts were made to contact Expedia, only to be put on hold or disconnected, phone call after phone call after phone call. After the vacation was over and I returned home, I tried calling Expedia to explain what happened. I was told by an agent, a supervisor, and a manager that it was not Expedia's fault because they did not cancel two of the rooms. An offer that was rescinded each time I asked to speak with someone with more authority. We chose Expedia because of its great reputation in dealing with customers. Expedia was supposed to be our agent, who we paid to make sure everything was problem free.  Expedia's only function is to act as an agent to the traveler in arranging these services. It just seems to me that Expedia dropped the ball. Expedia failed in customer service. Expedia was severely lacking in communicating with its customers when there was a problem.This was a simple problem with a simple solution.  I understand when traveling, mistakes can happen, but when they do, I need to trust that they will be handled in a swift and efficient way.

They told me some ridiculous $600 amount fee to change my hotel! That is more than me booking another hotel! I explained that the reason I needed to change it was because there is an advisory warning issued but the US government for Acapulco. So we wanted to go somewhere safer like Cancun. We were happy to pay any extra costs but the fees were simply ridiculous. So now I have a trip to a place I cannot go to and no change can be made, so $1200 is wasted.

Last Tuesday I did some research about a hotel in Manhattan. The first research did not bring me to a reservation. A few hours later, I repeated the research and then booked a hotel on the lowest available rate. Less than 24 hours after that, Expedia sent me an email with the title ""My notes from Mar 10"" where the hotel I had booked appeared US$50 cheaper per day. This email was certainly triggered by my first research, meaning they did not know I already had a reservation and were trying to pull me back. I contacted Expedia about their ""best price guarantee"" policy and they answered my saying that the new offer I showed them (their own!) did not qualify for the program.",refund"reservation Review from Holland, Michigan. Unbelievable! I used Expedia to book a hotel in Cleveland, TN. I accidentally entered the ""non-refundable"" reservation. This was the exact same price as the refundable reservation rate. I called Expedia, spoke to Kelly in customer service. I explained the problem, noting my error, and the only reason I booked this was because of the cancellation & no charge booking policy. She told me there is nothing she could do, but I could contact the hotel directly for a refund. So that's what I did. The hotel was even less helpful! I believe the front desk clerk's response was ""Oh it's Expedia. There's nothing we can do for you, get your refund from them.""Contacted my bank, tried to stop payment, but it already went through so there's not much they can do either.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, we had to cut our trip short and left 27 May 2017 around 4am which means the room could be re-rented. Since I'd already pre-paid through Expedia, Best Western was unable to give me the unused balance I'd paid for the room which they would have been able to do if I'd paid directly to them. When I got back home from New Mexico I contacted Expedia and asked for a refund. They refused to give me a refund because I didn't let Expedia know by 4pm on 26 May 2017 that I wouldn't need the room. We didn't even know we were going to leave at 4pm.

Cheating people after submitting medical & supporting documents.",insurance"I booked a hotel, flight and cancellation insurance.  Was ready to check out and received a prompt for a rental vehicle.  I followed the prompt, reviewed the rental options and decided against it.  But there was absolutely no way to leave that page and continue with the rest.

I booked a trip to Mexico and bought the insurance through Expedia that said you could change your flights one time and the insurance would cover your flight change fees. I changed my flights that resulted in $580 of fees. I submitted a claim. When I talked to a supposed supervisor, he said I have called in only 2 times, and that they would pay a $40 exchange fee, and not the fees I paid for changing my ticket. This is a total scam. Expedia does not honor they travel insurance. And even if they believed they would pay me only $40, they should have done it 3 months ago. Do not buy this insurance, and to not use Expedia. ",insurance"DON'T buy the trip insurance - you can't get your money !!. Expedia strongly advises you to buy Trip Insurance, but does not tell you, that they have NOTHING to do with the money we spen d - that's up to the airlines.

I rented a car from Dollar rent-a-car through Expedia for two weeks with what was purported to be unlimited mileage within the continental US. My biggest mistake turned out to be when I accepted the travel insurance coverage through Expedia. After picking up the car, I discovered in the small print of the terms that I was limited to travel to the two adjoining states. Since I was taking a cross country road trip, I immediately returned the car to Dollar and they, to there credit, quickly cancelled the agreement and only charged me a nominal one day rental charge. I then successfully into a rental agreement with Thrifty that met my needs. When I contacted Expedia to cancel the travel insurance for the two week Dollar rental that no longer existed, they refused. I have used Expedia on countless occasions, but that refusal to reimburse me for all but one days worth of travel insurance strikes me as patently unfair and totally unreasonable. Even though the amount of the expense is small and despite any sense of my wanting to support a local enterprise, Seattle being my home, I am left with such a sour taste in my mouth that I have decided to no longer use Expedia for any of my future bookings.",insurance"Resolved: EXPEDIA'S TRAVEL INSURANCE.

They inform me that the airline Delta did not offer that. I told them that I bought the insurance. They told me if it was a military emergency a medical emergency or a funeral, I would be covered. I then asked them why that's not listed on there when the screen pops up and says you should buy insurance? they told me that I should have read the policy and terms. which I guess I should have but $77 and its worthless! I will no longer be purchasing anything through Expedia for my family or our employees. Which amounts to several thousand dollars a year.

Didn't matter that this was stated nowhere on the site. I had to accept the coverage, or go without a rental. Having no place to print a copy of my coverage, I had to accept. I only did so because the agent told me that if I print the coverage at one of my hotels and bring it back with me, they would remove the insurance. Should have known that was *** from the start.

I have spent nine hours so far today to try to get a resolution to a problem.  At this very moment, I am on hold with ""Josh in El Salvador"" (he would not give me an ID number) one of your offshore supervisors for 2 hours and 12 minutes -- and continuing. On another phone, with another of your offshore agents -- after I told him NOT to put me on hold, he put me on hold, and that has been for 43 minutes. I just hung up on him. I also hung up on the call for which I was on hold for over 2 hours and 12 minutes -- and immediately got a call back from Josh. He says he is still trying to contact his supervisor and I MUST hold, or he will stop all efforts to get a resolution. He would give NO ESTIMATE of how long that would be. Obviously, they are playing games, trying to get the customer to give up.  I will not give up on this. Your offshore ""customer service"" is actually brutal customer abuse.  The original issue is that Expedia and your hotel partner both tried to extract money from me which was clearly not due. I have both written and electronic proof of that. But, trying to get Expedia to do something is impossible. I was promised that a supervisor would call me to confirm a resolution that we had agreed upon. That never happened.  Besides the most recent ""on hold"" examples, I was on hold two other times today for periods of greater than 30 minutes. There were also numerous holds for shorter periods of time.  Does ANYONE at Expedia really care about customers? There is a lot of evidence to prove that management does not. My expectation is that a responsible management person in the US will contact me to get this issue resolved. Your billing has now been disputed with my credit card company. I have given them some of the details of the abuse I have endured.  And, by the way, Josh just hung up on me after I held for another 34 minutes. He probably got the message that I was willing to out-wait him.",customer seriviceOther Product Review. This is a significant issue for me.

I was put on hold 12 times (I counted) and the total time on the phone was over 3 hours. 3. Not only did they not fix my issue, but they somehow ""misplaced"" $400 of my 626.20 refund.

I was then transferred to another department & waited 30 minutes before I hung up & called back. I spoke to another rep which saw both issues and he told me unfortunately the price has gone up again as well as putting my wife & son on a different flight and flight time which is unexceptable.

To say Expedia's customer service is horrible is an understatement. Whats even more appalling is that I'm sure these reviews are noticed by the Expedia executives and one can only assume they are as incompetent as the employees that work under them since it appears that nothing is being done to improve the customer experience. Hey Expedia! your customer service is disgusting. You should all be ashamed of yourselves for the way you treat your customers. Why would you charge my card for travel and not book nor email me the confirmation? To add insult to injury I have to get on the phone and make multiple calls since waiting on hold will always result in being disconnected. Your employees are reminiscent of the Island of misfit toys from the tv show Rudolph the Red nosed Reindeer. Why must I wait hours on end to speak to a supervisor?

Expedia Case: E-12745918 Issue #1 Feb 14, 2016 I had selected my flights via Expedia and was putting in my credit card details to pay, and suddenly the system kicked me out of that screen and another screen popped up saying that the price has gone up by $150. It's totally unreasonable for Expedia to treat customers like this. I then exit from your site and tried booking again after 5min, and guess what....surprise..surprise, the original price was available again! This is total daylight robbery and shame on Expedia to exploit customers this way. Issue #2 Feb 14, 2016 Following above experience, when the original price was available again on Expedia, I didn't want the same thing to happen again, so I booked my flight and paid as fast as possible, before Expedia can pull that same trick on me! I was relived when I saw the message indicating that the booking was confirmed.  When I received my itinerary via email a few minutes later, I noticed that I had made a small 'typo' error in my surname. Because I was trying to hurry my booking to avoid that ""We Gotcha!"" price increase, I had typed 'r' instead of 't' in my surname. I called Expedia immediately. The agent was friendly and said that this happens sometimes, but not to worry as she can either cancel the booking and re-book OR to call back in 24hrs, and she will be able to make the name correction without any penalties. I indicated to the agent that if I cancel/void this ticket now, I probably won't be able to get the same price. She agreed that I will have to pay the new price, if the price has gone up. Therefore, I was told that my best option is to call back after 24hrs, and Expedia will be able to make the name correction without any charges. So this was obviously the best option I was offered by Expedia. Feb 15, 2016 The next day I called Expedia to follow up. This agent said the same thing to me - we can make the name change with no charge. But he said that the airline has not released the booking or something to that effect, so he is not yet able to make the name correction. So I was asked to call back again another 24hr later. At this point, I asked the agent if this would incur a cost, because I knew that I am eligible to cancel the ticket within 24hrs with a full refund. But this will not be possible 48hrs after booking. However, the agent reassured that I will be able to make the name correction, with no fees, if I called back the next day, because its a single letter change,  Feb 16, 2016 I called Expedia again the next day, as requested by the 2nd agent. This time the 3rd agent said that they can make the name correction, and after some 1hr or so later on the phone, he said that there will be a $50 charge that Delta will be charging me for the name correction. Based on what Expedia had told me earlier, I refused to pay this fee. The agent didn't offer an alternative, so I asked to speak to a supervisor. He said that he will be transferring me to the 'corporate section', where I was again put on hold for another 45min to 1hr. Now a woman answered the phone and after explaining the entire situation to her, she agreed to reimburse the $50 that Delta would charge me for the name change. She called Delta and conferenced me in to the call. The Delta agent said that they can make the name correction, however, Delta cannot guarantee that my reservation with their partnering airline (Virgin Australia International) would still hold! As ludicrous as it sounds, both agents (from Delta and Expedia) told me that the best option I have now is to just keep my reservation as is, because they felt that TSA would not see an issue with just one letter being incorrect in my surname. I was not comfortable with this, so asked if either Delta or Expedia could send me an email confirming that they are aware of this error, so that I can present this at the airport, just in case, at the checking counter they refuse to issue my boarding pass. But Delta and Expedia said that they cannot help me with an email or letter of that nature. At this point, I felt completely cheated by Expedia. Only if they had given me accurate information the first time, I would have cancelled this ticket within 24hrs with a full refund and booked another flight instead. But now I am stuck in this quagmire with no solution from Expedia! Feb 19, 2016 I called Delta directly to see if they would be able to assist me. They said the same thing - they can make a name correction for a fee of $50, but still cannot guarantee Virgin Australia International would hold my original booking. He also indicated that if my name on the reservation is different to the passport, he cannot confirm that I will be issued a boarding pass at the airport. So looks like I'm in the ditch!  Being very concerned. I called Expedia again and spoke to an agent, then again to someone in the 'corporate office' and then to another person. After over 3hrs on the phone, Expedia still wasn't able to resolve this issue, that was caused by the misguidance given by Expedia agents in the first place! The last person I spoke to made every attempt to disown this problem and tried to put the blame on me! I was told that Expedia agents would not have advised me to call back to make the name correction, as its not within their process. That agent even said that, the moment I accepted the terms and conditions of the booking, I would now be fully responsible for any problems there after! How shameful of Expedia to treat customers like this! When I told the agent that I am very aware of the 24hrs cancellation policy with a full refund, she even tried to dismiss that! That's absolutely disgraceful customer support!!   The last thing this agent told me was that, they will be pulling the call recordings to determine exactly what the initial 2 agents advised me and that they will be calling me back within 3 to 4 days to confirm. Well, its been 10 days now and no one has called me!  Expedia, are you trying to make customers pay for the misguidance given by your call center agents?",customer serivice"Horrible customer service!.

I have booked through Expedia for 2 different trips to Las Vegas later this year (one March, one April).  One booking was flight and hotel, the other just hotel.  Prior to booking each, I called Expedia to check on some specific points (wording on hotel was somewhat ambiguous).  In each case I was put on hold while they contacted the hotel to check.  Both times they returned with the response I was hoping for and I booked.  The wording was a 'breakfast on us' deal but then also stated 'breakfast per stay' so the query was did this include breakfast daily or was just once over my entire visit. As the first trip has drawn closer, I decided to seek written confirmation as I have experienced issues before when hotels have tried to play dumb on included extras.  I contacted Expedia customer services via email and eventually received a response telling me 'breakfast was included in my trip'.  I subsequently sent another five requests worded in different ways, each misunderstood with responses confirming I got breakfast.  By this point I had already contacted the hotel direct who advised that I received credit for breakfast once, that was it.  Eventually a week after hearing from the hotel directly Expedia confirmed the same.  If I had known this up front I would not have booked through them as Virgin Holidays offered a much better deal and were prepared to price match (just didn't see the point as no need to). So, given this, I went through the same routine for the second booking which again ended with the same result.  I had been given incorrect information on the phone.  With breakfast costing approx. $30 per day per person at each hotel, this is not an insignificant amount over 6 nights and 7 nights.   My guess and limited defence of Expedia is that their call centres are based in India, so people are using their second language.  I am extremely annoyed with them though as I made the effort to call before booking to clarify.  If you cannot trust the people speaking to you on the phone to understand your questions and provide correct information, you cannot trust the company.  I am now of the view that I will try to avoid using Expedia again at all costs.  I have already cancelled the hotel only booking and booked direct through the hotel's website.",customer serivice"Will never use Expedia.  Corporate needs to read this.. You have people in the Philippines dealing with your customers that could care less.  I called three times to try to cancel a flight that evening because my daughter had caught the flu. Each time I was put on hold for 45 minutes!!!  The third time after being on hold for 45 minutes some guy picked up and after a conversation of 20 minutes, he said so you want to cancel the flight?  Completely frustrated I raised my voice and said yes.  He hung up on me.  I called Virgin America directly and it took 5 minutes to cancel.  Not only that but Expedia didn't tell me that if I had a doctors note, I could get my $150 rebooking fee back per ticket.  Moreover, the money goes into a bank at Virgin that anyone can use where at Expedia the same person has to use the ticket.  I have spent 10s of thousands of dollars with Expedia and was going to even buy a chunk of the stock.  No more.  Horrible service!  Your loss Expedia!",customer serivice"The worst customer service I have ever had the displeasure to deal with. I booked a hotel through Expedia in New York, looked great on the website.  Didn't look like that when I got there.  It was also in the landing path of LaGuardia airport, looked like the planes would hit the building they were so close.  ALL NIGHT LONG!. Thought that was the worst of it, but when I tried to get a receipt for my expenses, was told Expedia would have to do it since I booked from them.  Figured no problem,  three days now of dealing with hours of waiting on phones to get them on line.  When you do, they promise to email it right out.  They lie.  They can get you an ad real quick though.",customer seriviceExpedia booking Review. I have tried three times to speak with customer service in trying to complete an airline booking....each time they dropped the call after long silences... Very poor,customer serivice"Expedia customer service Review from East Northport, New York. Our representative became annoyed with us and would not put in sufficient effort to help solve our problem. The phone call ended on the representatives terms, when she transferred me to another misleading line. I would never use Expedia again or recommend it to any of my friends and family. The loops I had to jump through we're not worth it at all. Not happy with Expedia and more so it's unprofessional customer service.",customer serivice"Nightmare customer service. Wedding plans changed so I had to change two flight days and times. Same airlines. Shouldn�t be a challenge for Expedia, right? 3 phone calls, repeatedly put on hold for long waits, 2 disconnections, 2 agents, 3 supervisors, 5 different stories and never told the same change/cancellation fees. I had no idea who was telling the truth. I gave up.  This is not my first disappointment with Expedia.com. However, this one was over the top. In the grand scheme of things, they won't care at all. I�ll never use them again.",customer serivice"No customer service - Ex- pedia. I have spent 4 hours trying to resolve an issue for my ill daughter looking to return from Africa.  I have had 3 calls dropped, including one after 1 42 minutes wait on the phone for a supervisor.  I have called 6 times.  What does it take to get through and not have the call dropped? I am calling about an incorrect name, something that should take 5 minutes.  My daughter also spent 5 hours trying to get this resolved. If you are going to have customer service by phone, then you need to make sure the calls don't get disconnect,dropped, or I guess even worse if the expedia person just hung up",customer serivice"Other Product Review.

Give me what is rightfully mine, you pieces of ***.",customer serivice"Coupon Review from Los Ranchos De Albuquerque, New Mexico. Hi, I am contacting you because I recently had a horrible customer service experience. On Tuesday I called in because I saw an offer for 50% off if booked a hotel within 72 hours. I called in to book and the 1st representative I spoke with saw this offer and attempted to apply it. She told me that the hotel I wanted to book would not accept that coupon because it was already giving me a members discount. I then asked her if she would change the hotel to The Palmer House Hilton in Chicage and she told me that I could do it myself online. I informed her that it was not giving me the option to add a coupon code upon checkout. I tried to apply it while she was on the line and I hear he say ""oh my God"". I am assuming she thought she muted the phone. I brought this to her attention and asked of she was frustrated. She said no, and that she had to transfer me to another department to apply the code. Instead of transferring me to a different department (which I was told later that there isnt another department) she just dropped me back in the ***. The second representative failed to listen to the issue and offer any type of empathy or understanding. She said that she could no longer see the offer and she would just add a $50 coupon for the inconvenience. I informed her that it wasn't sufficient as I was told I would be getting 50% and the previous rep could see that coupon. She informed she couldn't see it and there was nothing that could be done. I then asked to be �transferred to a manager. The manager then came on the line and again failed to offer any type of customer service. No empathy was shown to me for having been on the phone for almost 2 hours, and she also said that there was nothing she could do. I asked to speak with another manager and she said there was a department that was over her and she would transfee me. I waited on hold another 30 minutes and then the call was disconnected on me. I am truly upset as I have booked hotels and flights with you guys. I wold like for someone to reach out to me so that I can get this resolved.� Thanks, Jerrod Williams",customer serivice"Worse ever!. I have used several travel services and Expedia is the absolute worse.  Do not book anything through them.  There customer service is horrible.  The wait times, when you have an issue are 20 to 40 minutes.  They are happy to work with you and assist in getting your money, but when you need help, forget about it!!!!  Booked a hotel through Expedia, had to leave early due to the weather.  When I called for a refund, I got bounced back and forth.  Was told to call the hotel for refund.  Called the hotel, they had no problem but since it was booked through Expedia, I had to go through them.  They again said I had to go through the Hotel.  Called the Hotel,  talked to the Manager, and they said this is normal on cancellations and they are happy to do what they can but the billing and therefore the refund on my card had to go through Expedia.  Still trying to get Expedia to refund!!!!  Like I said, don't walk, run from EXPEDIA.com!!!!",customer serivice"The Decline of Expedia. I just spent over an hour on the phone with Expedia trying to do a simple flight change. I was very patient as they shuffled me around to various departments, placed me on multiple hold, and repeated myself at least 5 times because both the agent and supervisor did not speak English well. At the end of his hour the rates had gone up by $30. I explained to the supervisor that their inadequacies should not be my penalty and asked him to honor the difference as I have been a loyal customer for several years. Not only did he take that opportunity to save my business but he did not even acknowledge the inconvenience. Expedia will be out of business soon. Google Flights is not only a superior product but also much more convenient and customer focused. Do not waste any more time with Expedia.",customer seriviceExpedia Booking Review. Expedia is Horrible. This is the first and last time I will use this service. They screwed up my reservation. Then when I tried to rectify I was on the phone for 2 days for hours on end. They must have put me on hold 50 times and each time for a good 20 minutes or more and after all this I still haven't gotten their screwup fixed.  DO NOT USE EXPEDIA!!!!!,customer serivice"Hold for ever. Arrived at airport at 7:35AM for Flight to Hawaii, with flight departure time of 9:30AM. We received no email addressing this change in flight time. Hawaii airlines employee stated we missed our flight. We were very upset. She also stated that this is not the first time that Expedia failed to communicate with their customer as to time changes. She also stated that they had seats available for the next Flight which would leave at 7:30am on 1/9/16.  We immediately called Expedia customer service from the airport and requested to be rebooked on this flight. We never got a straight answer and then went to supervisor. After approximately 90 minutes we were disconnected. This continued through out the day with a total time of at least 6 hours on hold then being disconnected. The airlines were are savior as they booked us for the next day. Expedia was rude and never is there any need to be place on hold and disconnected at least 5 times after more then an hour hold. It was an emotional roller coaster that day",customer serivice"Two & a half hours on the phone waiting for bad news. I booked airline reservations seven months ago, July 2015 with Expedia. Everything went smoothly, then in Jan. 2016 they abruptly changed my flights with American Airlines and refused to change or cancel my reservations and go with another carrier.  I waited 2 & 1/2 hours waiting on the phone for this outcome.  Do not use them, they do not really want to help you, especially if you are disabled and forced to sit in seats difficult to get to.  What's the purpose of making reservations 10 months in advance only to be bumped off and given the worst seats on a plane??",customer serivice"Excellent customer service. I booked three rooms in the hotel ""Dream Bangkok"" through Expedia. However, the circumstances changed (two of my family members are not able to join us for the trip) and I had to cancel one room. I went to the Expedia website and found out that this reservation is not eligible for cancellation. I haven't done complete research but I think this is hotel policy because some reservation can be cancelled in Expedia. I decided to call Expedia as I didn't wanted to pay for the room we will not need. The way it works is you put your phone number on Support website and someone from Expedia will call you back within five minutes. I got an incoming within fifteen seconds. I explained my story to the customer service representative and he told me about how this particular reservation cannot be cancelled, but however, much to my surprise, he told me that he is going to call the hotel and see if he can get the hotel to agree to cancel reservation for one room. After being few minutes on hold, he came back and said that no one with the authority is available at this time (it was 3 AM Bangkok time) and I should call Expedia back in few hours. I obliged and called them back. The second customer service representative was equally helpful. She said she found some notes left by the previous representative and she is going to call the hotel right now. Long story short, she managed to cancel my extra reservation. This is the most helpful and not to mention sympathetic customer service experience I ever had. I am off course happy to get my refund but more importantly this was a very pleasant experience through and through. Very well done Expedia!",customer serivice"Expedia Booking Review from Bellevue, Washington. After 3 hours and 20 minutes on the phone with this company, my original fare doubled, I was treated like garbage by their Manager Diego and ended up in tears and with a severe asthmatic reaction. After faithfully using this service for 10 years, I am appauled by the disdain with which I was treated. After doubling the price of my ticket, the corporate services representative proceeded to tell me that the experience I received was my fault, and that had I sumply acquiesced to the policy recitals dished out to me, I would have had a speedy resolve. Silly me for thinking that behind policies were human beings who could make a judgement call based a client's situation... There is absolutely no advantage to using this service. Had I gone directly through the airline, I would have ended up spending less and not being treated like a fool... I would admonish the public, do not use this service. Masked behind the promise of low fares is a racket to sell a series of one-way tickets at the ultimate expense of the customer. You will never win with Expedia!

As I have a long wait at Incheon, perhaps a good way to spend my time here is to write a long post about Expedia Customer Care. I am not one of the online complainers. In fact, I believe that this is the first time I vent my anger publicly since the inception of the Internet, but I thought that sharing my experience might help others. This time I really don�t know what else I could do, the way @Expedia (@ExpediaAsia) has been dealing with me is truly beyond comprehension. Instead of an emotional outburst, let me simply state the facts, in chronological order.(1) I bought a ticket on @Expedia many months ago from Hong Kong to Lisbon on Turkish Airlines.(2) Two weeks ago I received an email with subject ""URGENT: PLEASE CALL Flight change"".  It explained that Turkish airlines had changed their schedules and thus my flights would have to be rescheduled.  Completely normal so far.(3) I called the number provided (+852 3077 5711), and after going through many menu options I got the ""all out agents are busy"" response and was asked to leave a message. (4) Two hours later an agent returned my call from Phoenix, AZ (+14802708191). He repeated what�s in the email and told me that he would refer my case to their ticketing department. He couldn�t tell me anything about alternative options, but promised that an agent would call within a day or two.(5) The next day I received a second email, in which they thanked me  for contacting them ""under case-id S-128330245"" and that their ""concerned team will contact [me] within 07-10 days"".(6) Not knowing why this would take 7-10 day, I responded to their email asking to let me know how to get in touch with an agent who actually can help. This in return triggered another email from Expedia, in which they informed me, in Cantonese, that they are not able to deal with English messages (_________________________________________).(7) I asked somebody in the office to try to track them down and speak with them in Cantonese. She managed to speak with different people repeatedly over a period of three days, but all they said to her is that somebody ""will contact"" me. The last phone call was 10 days ago, but still not a word from @Expedia (@ExpediaAsia).(8) What I got instead was an email request to fill in a form to indicate how satisfied I was with their customer service.I have used @Expedia many times in the past. Obviously, when the flights don�t change, their role is limited to issuing the tickets. Clearly, they are just plain miserable when a follow-up action is needed. I am not particularly worried about losing this booking (there are so many other exciting destinations), but let me know if you have an idea of how to move forward.",customer serivice"NO customer service from Expedia. I made a reservation through Expedia and received a confirmation by email.  When I tried to check into the hotel they did not have my reservation and they were sold out.  I called Expedia who claimed their computers were down and to call back in 2 hours.  I told them this was not acceptable and I needed assistance.  I spent 2.5 hours on the phone with 3 agents, 2 managers and long periods of time on hold.  I had to call back twice after being cut off.  In the end it turns out that Expedia takes no responsibility for the service they offer, left me to find another hotel on my own, pay the additional cost of a more expensive room with no discounts that I had with my additional reservation and added cab fare to get to another hotel.  Expedia does not apologize, offer assistance or care.  DO NOT USE EXPEDIA.  They take advantage of people who believe they have received a service with honesty and integrity.  Expedia has none!",customer serivice"On hold for 4 hours. Could not answer my question about a refund - they place you on hold hoping you go away!

Expedia then blames the airline saying it's the airlines rules that keep them from giving a refund, when it's Expedia!",customer serivice"WORST customer service I have ever experienced. Lost my money and spent 5 hours on phone with customer service for NO SOLUTION!. This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. I was a loyal customer of Expedia for many years.  I entered flight #4523 - they did not say in any way shape or form that the flight I entered was changed to 4244. Somehow they took my money and put me on #4323 at 6am instead of 4523 @6pm. I figured this out when I went to go choose my seat. I called expedia and explained I could not get to the airport at 6am for my flight since I was staying 3 hours away and there were no rental car companies open for business at 2am! They kept me on the phone for 2.5hours and the call dropped or they hung up on me. I called back to wait on hold for another 3 hours because they did not notate my account so I had to go through the entire explanation all over again. First they told me it would be $200 to change my flight time, then the next manager told me it would be $386 to change flight time. They wasted my time and gave me the run around only to ruin my trip and steal my hard earned money.   I was so desperate that I called American airline after crying while having a panic attack. American Airlines fixed my problem and clearly told me to NEVER book through expedia again. So I called expedia to close my account and they told me they would cancel my reservation if I closed my account! That is HORRIBLE!! They robbed me then held my reservation as ransom to have me not close the account. I have accumulated thousands of point over the years with expedia and cannot believe they are willing to lose a lifetime loyal customer over this. This is the worst experience I have ever had with any company in my entire life. This is now my life mission to inform everyone in any which way I can, to NEVER book through this company unless they want heartache pain and theft of their money. I am so upset and cannot believe what a day I've had dealing with them. I truly hate expedia and am planning on speaking with my HR department on Monday morning so that they lose over 400 business customers listed under my employer's account. WORST company in the world!

One agent said she would call me back - never happened.  She said she would leave notes for another agent - nope.  I am now on agent two - who is ruder and less interested than the last one.  Why am I stuck ruining my day due to their incompetence?  The best part?  Their website won't let me complain!

NO WE DID NOT CLICK ON I ONLY NEED A HOTEL FOR PART OF MY STAY. The manager was attempting to get an answer for us and never got back to us or gave a reason as to why this happened. I think their method is to keep you on hold as long as possible so that you eventually hang up. I don't know how they are business when they allow to leave their customers on hold for over 5 hours while they are on vacation! To conclude, we never received and answer from expedia.com or explanation. We eventually hung up the phone after 5 hours in total frustration which basically ruined half of our vacation.

They were unable to find the new changes I asked for, even though I had the website open in front of me and the flight I wanted was available.

After literally 2.5 hours of being on the phone, the Expedia customer service told me: 1) It's not possible to change the date of the return flight 2) If i cancel the ticket or a part of the ticket, I will not get a refund nor airline credits (however, on my itinerary it clearly states that if I cancel the ticket I can get airline credits) 3) The only option I had was to book another one way ticket on a different airlines for $770 extra (keeping in my mind that I am losing money from the return ticket I already had) I hung up the phone after 2.5 hours without any solution to my problem. I went on Air France website again and tried to change the flight myself, somehow it worked. I was able to change the date of my return flight without any difficulty, it cost me $190. So, Expedia customer were no help at all. I do not understand why their system is different and doesn't show all the flights that the general public is able to see on expedia.com And I still don't understand why it took Expedia and Air France 2.5 hours to figure out how to change the date of a flight and failing to do so.

The transfer problem happened on my last trip and I let it slide.  I must complain after it happened a second time.   My major concern is that when I called back numerous times, they put me on hold multiple times.  I never received an answer to the question.  I am so upset with myself for using this company.

THIS IS THE 2ND ATTEMPT TO FILE A COMPLAINT . . .  Expedia ruin my vacation . . . I booked two non-smoking double beds with ocean front for 7 people.  The rooms were to be side by side.  One room had 4 adults and the other room had 2 adults and a 17 yr old child (3 people).  When I arrived to Bermuda, (Grotto Bay), Expedia sent the wrong information to the hotel.  They were putting us in a Room with King size beds.  Unacceptable!  The hotel tried to accommodate us but the only room they had smelled like smoke and they were not close by each other.  We had to wait another day to get rooms which were ocean view, not ocean front.  I was on the phone for over 2 hours with Expedia. After two hours of speaking with over 4 different people, I finally spoke with a supervisor name John and he informed me to start over again. Again, Unacceptable behavior by a supervisor. . .

When I entered my check in date everything was fine.  When I entered my check out date the website jumped ahead several days.  I fixed it twice, then checked to see if multiple nights were required to reserve.  Multiple nights were not necessary, I fixed the check out date and entered my reservation.  On my confirmation Expedia booked me for 3 nonrefundable nights when I only wanted 1.  Within 4 minutes I was on the phone with an Expedia representative.  I explained the situation, waited a while on hold and when he returned I was told that he had spoken to a manager and then ASSURED me that this would be taken care of and that they would send me a $50 certificate for my trouble.  Very, very nice. Easy. Two days later I get an email that the hotel is holding me to the reservation (not their fault). I email Expedia to explain, they tell me to call 1-800-EXPEDIA.  I call, request a supervisor, get put on hold for 10 minutes, then get disconnected.  I call back, request a supervisor and the representative says, ""IF WE GET DISCONNECTED, IS THIS THE NUMBER YOU WOULD LIKE US TO CALL YOU BACK ON?""  After 24 minutes of holding, I hangup.  Within a minute, the representative CALLS ME BACK.  I ask her to have a supervisor call me and again, I email Expedia to explain and ask for a supervisor to call.  NO JOKE, I get an email back saying that supervisors cannot make outgoing calls!  Really?  Representatives can make outgoing calls, but supervisors cannot?  I requested a direct number to speak to a supervisor.  No response.  No help.  They tell me to call the 800 number. Expedia does not want to stand behind their product.  They will not admit to a computer error.  They will not stand behind their original promise to take care of the situation, and they are making no attempt to rectify the situation. I always did all of my travel bookings with Expedia.  The site is easy to use and fortunately never needed help from them.  Now that I needed help with THEIR mistake, they are unwilling to help.   It is a scary world right now.  You may need to change plans.  It would be nice to know that Expedia has your back.  If you are away, are you going to want to spend 25 minutes on your cellphone trying to get through to Expedia?  By the way, there have been 17 emails back and forth, most of Expedia's are auto generated from telling me how much they value me and to call the 800 number. Are you going to want empty promises?

Tried to make a booking through Expedia for a double room. The web site would only allow one name despite repeatedly trying to add a second. Booking went through for single occupancy. Contacted Expedia explaining a room was needed for double occupancy. Received a standard email quoting that my itinerary had been updated. It never was - contacted the hotel and explained the situation who accepted the additional person but right up to the date of travel the itinerary was not updated and subsequently - guess what's- we were given a room which was only suitable for single occupancy.

I have used Expedia a bunch of times successfully.  Their rates online are good.  If you find yourself in a situation where you need to change a flight time- good luck, you are on your own.  I was on the phone for a total of 2.5 hours yesterday afternoon.  The first tier of customer service answers the phone quickly (w/in 1-2 minutes).  It goes downhill after that.  No one can seem to help you, so they need to have you speak to a supervisor which will take another 40 minutes on hold.  After that, they refer you to the corporate office, which is another hour hold, until it gets so late that they tell you the office is closed.  Are you given a direct number for the a.m. or a promise for an early a.m. call back?  NO.  It starts all over again the next day.  I tried googling the corporate office phone number directly.  Not much luck here either.  My first try, the phone range 100x's.

I called back the next day and got a really nice gentleman who tried diligently to help me.  I was on the phone with him for over an Hour and a Half.  My problem was not resolved.  I called back a third time was transferred and stayed on hold another 25 minutes no one ever picked up.

The motel told me there was ""nothing "" she could do, and Expedia ""customer service"" was WORTHLESS: ""nothing"" they could do, either.

I had booked my entire honeymoon with Expedia and after my mother passed away, I wanted to cancel my honeymoon because of this unfortunate sad situation. My fianc� and I have sent countless emails and spent over 6 hours on the phone with different Expedia ""customer service'"" agents who have claimed to be helping us, however, each one said they would cancel and request a refund in regards to the circumstances but not a single one has. In fact, I took matters into my own hand and contacted one of the hotels myself, the hotel said they have not received any cancellation request and would gladly refund our trip but can't do this until Expedia contacts them (Expedia had claimed to have contacted them 3 times and even went as far as to claim the hotel denied our refund, the hotel did not even receive a request).

THANKS EXPEDIA.",customer serivice"Horrible Service and Unethical Business. Horrible service and unethical business. So to be clear with everyone: I called Expedia on March 9th to cancel a trip to Puerto Rico. which was 9 days off. I waited 1 hour to get to speak with a service rep. who then put me on hold for an hour to get a hold of a supervisor, who then took an hour to cancel my trip for my 2 hotel rooms and flight.  I asked that they retrieve the service voice recording to show that the Sale Rep stated no less than three times that the trip could be cancelled with 7 days notice. and to have this escalate to an officer of the company to call me back. They stated they would have someone get back to me immediately and the recording would take 5-10 days to pull and they would follow-up with me. They did nether. Now things go further downhill  I get my AMX bill and they only cancelled one of the rooms on March 9th.  I am now considered a no show at the hotel. It gets worse. They never canceled the flight and now Jet Blue considers me a no show. In the service notes read by the service rep is documented to cancel the whole reservation. How do only then cancel part of the trip??  Who would you say is at fault here. What would most companies do in this situation. They would reimburse me(you) for the cancellation and take ownership of their mistake. Expedia's response it to say I did not show up for the Hotel and Flight and I am responsible - of course I did not show up because I cancelled the trip. What do they do next? They ask me to stay on the phone to call the airline and hotel to ask on my behalf if they will reimburse me. Have you ever heard of a company calling one of their vendors to ask for them to reimburse the costumer for their mistake and blame the costumer for their issue.  I went through the same absurd discussion with their corporate service department with similar wait times.

I just had the worst experience with Expedia online and calling the call center. I tried to book a round trip flight  Las Vegas to Minneapolis online - received a message stating there were some difficulties and to try again. I did and I even tried a different credit card, but nothing worked. So I called 800-316-0357. They found the flight I was trying to reserve.  Put through the credit card.  I was asked what kind of card that was.  I said a check card - she said they don't take those.  So I gave her my American Express Card and that didn't work either. About 45 minutes later I was transferred to another agent who went through the same process with no luck.  She even received the same error message that I did. Then I was told that the flight went up to $349 from the original $319.  I told her that I wanted the original flight price since I had now been on the phone for about 90 minutes and it was not my fault that the price increased.  She said she couldn't do anything about that and offered a $50 gift credit for future packages, but could not use that toward this flight.  I decided not to book. I then went back onto your site and found the price was still $319.  I again tried to purchase and I received the same ""unable to purchase, try back later message."" I then went onto Travelocity and purchased the same exact flight for $319 in less than 10 minutes and they accepted my Check Card.
