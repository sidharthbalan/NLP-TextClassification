"I am a widow for 18 months on disability. February, 2020 I decided that I would like to go to Hawaii, for my birthday in May. I made all the arrangements and paid including the insurance. When COVID 19 hit I canceled my trip April 18 and spoke with as representative from Expedia who assured me that there was no problem in receiving my money back. I was informed that the money would be deposited back onto my credit card 30 days after the original date of flight.""Due to covid19, I was not able to go to the hotel I booked in Greece. Expedia instructed for me to cancel the booking and they were going to provide a voucher. This is a 2794.05 dollars reservation. Hotel did contacted me directly but when I started asking question on how I would make the booking in the future, they said to contact Expedia. Right now I have called Expedia 6 times with no response. I keep getting I will get an answer in 7 days. I submitted a claim on my credit card and Expedia did respond to that stating that I refused the coupon, which is a lie. Please do not book with Expedia if you want to avoid being in this horrible position. Booking.com was great to my best friend. Use booking.com or any other website for that matter. I strongly believe that how companies behave during this crisis, is how they were be looked at in the future. Expedia response has been the worst."I stayed in a hotel through Expedia. The fire alarm was hanging from the ceiling by a cord and the electrical outlet was broken... I told the hotel I would not stay there with my underage sister and they said I would have to ask Expedia for a refund. Expedia said I should have canceled 24 hours in advance. I sent Expedia pictures and asked for refund and they said that it was not their issue and offered no help. I advised them it was a fire issue and they again said the hotel policy was I would need to cancel 24 in advance."I very clearly booked tickets through Expedia that specified that there was a free change of tickets. I even snapped screenshots of the policy before booking the tickets, because this is the age of Corona, and I did not want to get stuck with thousands of dollars that would not be honored if our plans had to change last minute. When I spent an hr (seriously) on the phone with a foreign agent to change our tickets by moving them up a week, it took him an hour to tell me that I can't change my flight unless it is to the same airline. Why did I book with expedia if not for the flexibility of multiple airlines? And how can you write ""no change fee"" clearly with no stipulation that this only applies to changes that would be on the same airline? After this 1 hr useless conversation, I was put on hold to speak to to a manager and then cut off after another 10 minute wait. I will not be using Expedia again.""If you book a hotel, and you cancel your plans, you lost your money. I tried to take down/edit my own review on a hotel after having a really bad experience and they just won't do it. I do not recommend this website.""I booked a cruise last March for a November cruise through Costco travel, it is now July. Through Expedia I also booked 2 hotels, two nights each, and the flight home from Miami. After the Cruise we were going to rent a car and drive down to Key West, drive back to Miami, stay there two days, then fly home. Because of Covid-19 there were issues with the Cruise so we had to cancel, (Costco Travel gave a full refund) therefore we had to cancel everything else. Expedia, who advertises full refunds, DON'T...WON'T!! Keeping in mind it is 5 months away. Expedia said the Hotel ""The Best Hotel"" in Miami rated #6 of hotels in Miami, doesn't give refunds. I have never heard of that."I had to cancel my Hotel Reservation in Budapest due to the Covid virus. I took out Hotel cancellation with Expedia. I have not received a refund and the insurance company they use has changed 3 times now. It is AON Affinity. They need a letter stating what the value of the Voucher would be so I can get a refund. I have called many times not to receive an answer and the chat line is useless as they don't respond. I will never use Expedia again. I have wasted approximately 4 calls waited approx. 10 hours total with no response."I had a trip booked april 3rd. thru Expedia and due to the covid-19, this trip had to be cancelled due to the no fly restrictions from the usa and to other countries. The information from expedia and the hotels was that if cancellations happened due to this, refunds would be granted. It's now 4 months after the cancellation and I haven't received a refund from expedia even though I have email and phone confirmation from the hotel (Melia Llana Beach Resort & Spa - All Inclusive Adults Only) that they will honor the full refund."Our trip was cancelled in May due to the virus. Expedia said we had to file a claim with the travel insurance company. We did twice. Travel insurance said Expedia was the company that had to reimburse us. Expedia says we didn't cancel in 14 days. Every other company we have dealt with had excellent customer service and realized we could not predict a pandemic. We followed Expedia's directions from the beginning. They are not there for their customers. I wonder how much money they have stolen due to the virus. Sad!"I travel frequently, and always choose the �book now, pay at hotel� option with free cancellation. Expedia makes you give a cc # for a �deposit.� It has not been a problem until recently. I had two separate hotels which charged my credit card the FULL AMOUNT (deposit???) at time I made the reservation. Both these rooms were cancelled within the prescribed time frame. It�s now 3 days after the reserved/cancelled date, and several days after I cancelled the rooms. After speaking with a customer service rep, found out it will now take up to 14 days for the refund to process. So to sum things up, the hotels get to hold on to my $$$ for a month on a room which was cancelled according to policy.""July 2020. I'm really pissed. Service the worst possible. I didn't get any confirmation of the flight one day before flight! It is impossible to talk to the staff - poor call quality, the interlocutor hardly speaks English. Finally a call from the hotline at 5 am ... People, what service!""On January 5th, 2020 I purchased three roundtrip tickets for a trip to Japan via Expedia on Air Canada for our Nephew�s 2020 graduation (trip totaling $2761.53). The dates of travel were June 17th through June 27th. On May 23rd Expedia indicated that our flight on Air Canada had been cancelled due to COVID-19, and that we would automatically be issued a credit. Expedia claims their policy is in accordance with the airline and we would be contacted shortly. As of June 5th we had not been contacted by Expedia about our options, and we know that this flight falls under the US DOT refund policy.""I recently booked a car rental through Expedia. I was charged the cars damaged, collision and got my confirmation form for a total price of $217.89 from Expedia. My wife picked up the vehicle using my credit card, I noticed I was charged a total of $350 from the vendor even though I had booked it through Expedia for a set price and ended up paying $132.11 more from what was in my confirmation letter I received from Expedia. When talking to Expedia customer support trying to explain the situation, he was no help at all and found him to be quiet rude, saying, ""We didn't charge you anything and booking through us regardless of having a confirmation agreement doesn't matter, nothing I can do for you.""""We had a Bali vacation for 4 of us for June 25 to July 7. We fully paid for it in January. I PAID FOR FULL INSURANCE ON THIS TRIP (and every trip for 20 years with Expedia.) When Covid hit, I tried to cancel & Expedia wouldn't even answer phone until ""72 hours before the trip."" When I called 6/23 & finally got through, they didn't acknowledge my insurance, but kept me on the phone for 2+ hours calling the airline. I got an obscure e-mail that the airline was canceled (China Air actually canceled the flights on June 9th and no refund). But the hotel they said, ""you get a credit to be used until 6/2021"". But I paid for a FULL REFUND, not a ""credit"" for a hotel halfway around the world that I will never go to! I spoke to FOUR different people, each with a heavier accent & more patronizing than the next. I'm a 20-year user and member of Expedia. This has been the worse."I used Expedia to book air travel for 3 family members. Trip cancelled for 2 due to Covid-19. I also purchased travel insurance. Called Expedia to cancel air reservations for 2 of the 3 travelers and issue refund. They can't do it - customer has to call the travel insurance company whose policy was sold to customer by Expedia - Expedia providing -0- value here."Long story short, we didn�t make it to our flight because the company never actually ticketed our booking. We got to the airport with the booking confirmation and confirmed itinerary and the airline told us that there were no tickets in their system since Expedia didn�t actually purchase them on their end. We called them and spent 5 hours On the phone with 3 of them on hold. They weren�t able to fix the mistake or book a ticket because they didn�t want to pay the difference and almost made us to do that! That was a nightmare!!""Lesson learned. Do not ever book flights through a 3rd party. With Covid 19 going on, it was a nightmare from being on hold for 4 hours and then being hung up multiple times. Yesterday, it was a lot easier to get a rep on the phone, however, the first rep I talked to ALLIE hung up the phone on me after I requested to follow up on a refund that was issued on April 9th 2020 that never showed up on my bank account. She asked to put me on hold and then 10 seconds later hung the phone up on me.""I booked two hotels in Italy for my honeymoon in May of 2020. When the coronavirus hit, Italy stopped allowing people into the country. However, Expedia would not offer me a refund for my two hotel reservations. I was passed from person to person, none of which offered any assistance. They simply said ""oh well, nothing I can do"". I don't understand how they can keep my money, when I paid for a service and they didn't provide that service. This is a morally corrupt company that kept $2500 of my money.""I have been trying to get my travel refund of $640.17 from Expedia, I've had to wait on the phone for 2 hours just to talk to someone, and when they finally answer they put me in hold for up to 3 hours trying solve something they did. I book my flight, I bought my flight through them 7 months in advance using AA and they change my return flight to Air Canada, then they cancel my flight without prior notice and the only reason they give me is that there are no flight until January 2021, this confusion is all expedia fault, the customer services does not know and does not want to help you.""Firstly, let it be known I have all booking documents so if either of these shady companies has the courage to challenge this review, I more than welcome it... So I booked a Marriott hotel room over Expedia. Arrived at the hotel just a few hours after booking and the hotel doors are locked. A makeshift sign tells visitors to walk around the building to side entrance. (Strike 1) I drag multiple bags to the other side of building only to find that door is also locked so I picked up the house phone. (strike 2) Some lady comes on stating the hotel is closed, even though I see many cars and guests leaving and coming. So what they meant to say was ""we gave your room away."" She did say that they had just emailed me. Email has still not arrived notifying me that I no longer have a room. This is 5 hours after being denied my room which was fully paid for.""As per ExpediaPlusGold (I am a long time member) emails advises (I sent numerous emails explaining my issues about refunds for canceled flights and every email from Expedia would suggest to call them as they can not solve the problem via emails) I tried many times to reach Expedia live representative for quite a while. And when I am lucky to get through and explain my situation described in details in the emails to Expedia, after I provide the itinerary numbers and explain the refund issues... Expedia representative... just hangs up. It happens a few times, not once, not twice but a FEW TIMES!!! IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!"We booked a condo in Florida and booked airline tickets. Three days later we received a cancellation saying there was a double booking. There was no offer of an alternative rental or a reimbursement of flight cost. Never use Expedia!"Absolutely terrible. Would NEVER book through Expedia again. CSRs are not in US, English is terrible. Claimed they were providing a refund (which 4 attempts and hours on the phone) and in the end they provided a travel coupon to be used through Expedia. When I attempted to use the coupon, it seemed to be only for trip packages which I did not want. Once again I have to call customer service to figure out why I cannot use my money! Upon calling, I was transferred to three different people and still holding... Absolutely the worst service if you run into problems such as a pandemic. But I would worry about any other time as well.""We went to book a room at a B&B that we had stayed at previously. We used Expedia because of the price and purchased the insurance. When the COVID virus hit, we were informed that AIG would not cover cancellations due to this. Rather, they refunded the insurance premium. The hotel was willing to work with us. This hotel never received payment, however, Expedia received $206 for the booking and never refunded it. Think twice before booking through Expedia. My information was that if we had asked for the Expedia price, the hotel would have gladly accommodated us. We won't use them again.""We made plans to travel on airBaltic in June. The flight was arranged through Expedia.com, and we paid the airfare in advance. Because of the COVID pandemic, the flight was canceled. I communicated with Expedia to request a refund, but their response suggested I deal directly with the airline. I called airBaltic in Riga, Latvia (at no small expense), only to be told that the refund had to be made by Expedia."
